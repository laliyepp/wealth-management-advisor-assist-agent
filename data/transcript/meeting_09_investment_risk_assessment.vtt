WEBVTT

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:08.299
SPEAKER_00: Good morning, Amanda. Let's talk about your investment portfolio and risk tolerance.

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:17.445
SPEAKER_01: Perfect timing. I've been-- I've been losing sleep over the market volatility lately.

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:28.585
SPEAKER_00: That's actually a good sign that we should review your risk allocation. When did you start feeling uncomfortable?

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:36.225
SPEAKER_01: Probably around the banking crisis earlier this year. My portfolio dropped like fifteen percent in two weeks.

00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:41.901
SPEAKER_00: And how did that make you feel? Did you consider selling?

00:00:46.465 --> 00:00:51.705
SPEAKER_01: Honestly? Yeah. I kept checking my account balance multiple times a day.

00:00:52.505 --> 00:01:03.145
SPEAKER_00: That's a classic sign you might be taking more risk than you're comfortable with. Let's review your current allocation. What do you have right now?

00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:10.319
SPEAKER_01: Um, mostly Canadian and US stocks. Maybe eighty-five percent equities, fifteen percent bonds.

00:01:12.585 --> 00:01:16.984
SPEAKER_00: That's quite aggressive. What's your age again?

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:23.447
SPEAKER_01: Thirty-eight.

00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:37.105
SPEAKER_00: So the traditional rule of thumb would be sixty-two percent stocks, thirty-eight percent bonds. You're significantly more aggressive than that.

00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:43.080
SPEAKER_01: I thought you were supposed to be aggressive when you're young?

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:57.220
SPEAKER_00: You can be, but only if you can handle the volatility emotionally. If you're losing sleep and wanting to sell during downturns, that's counterproductive.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.484
SPEAKER_01: So what should I be thinking about?

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:16.700
SPEAKER_00: Risk tolerance has multiple dimensions. There's your financial capacity for risk - how much you can afford to lose. And your emotional tolerance - how much volatility you can handle.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.895
SPEAKER_01: What's my financial capacity?

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:34.180
SPEAKER_00: Well, you're making... what was it... eighty-five thousand? Good job security, no dependents, emergency fund in place. You can probably handle significant volatility financially.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.178
SPEAKER_01: But emotionally it's harder?

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:51.660
SPEAKER_00: Seems like it. And that's totally normal. The key is finding an allocation where you won't panic-sell during the inevitable downturns.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.741
SPEAKER_01: How do we figure that out?

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:11.140
SPEAKER_00: Let's run through some scenarios. In two thousand and eight, the S&P five hundred dropped about fifty-seven percent peak to trough. How would you feel if your portfolio dropped fifty percent?

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.691
SPEAKER_01: Terrified. I'd probably sell everything.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:27.620
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so we need to design a portfolio where even in a severe bear market, your losses feel manageable. What about a thirty percent drop?

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.660
SPEAKER_01: That would still be scary, but... maybe I could stick it out?

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:46.100
SPEAKER_00: Good. So we want to target maximum drawdowns around thirty percent. That probably means something like sixty-forty stocks to bonds, maybe seventy-thirty.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.390
SPEAKER_01: But won't that hurt my long-term returns?

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:04.580
SPEAKER_00: A bit, yes. But here's the thing - if you panic-sell during a crash, you lock in those losses. Better to have lower returns but actually stay invested.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.620
SPEAKER_01: That makes sense. What kind of returns are we talking about?

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:24.060
SPEAKER_00: Historically, a sixty-forty portfolio has averaged around... um... seven too eight percent annually. Your current eighty-five fifteen might do nine to ten percent, but with much higher volatility.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.100
SPEAKER_01: Is one to two percent difference that big a deal?

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:43.540
SPEAKER_00: Over thirty years? It's significant. But only if you actually earn those returns. If you sell during crashes and miss the recovery, you could do much worse.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.385
SPEAKER_01: Good point. What about within the stock allocation?

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.180
SPEAKER_00: Good question. You mentioned Canadian and US stocks. What's the split there?

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.060
SPEAKER_01: Maybe fifty-fifty? I've got VTI for US and VCN for Canada.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:20.500
SPEAKER_00: That's pretty home country biased. Canada's only about three percent of global market cap, but you've got fifty percent there.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.233
SPEAKER_01: Is that bad?

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:35.526
SPEAKER_00: Not necessarily. Canadian dividends get better tax treatment, and currency hedging has value. But you're missing out on diversification.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.953
SPEAKER_01: What would proper diversification look like?

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:55.429
SPEAKER_00: Maybe twenty-five percent Canada, forty percent US, twenty percent international developed, fifteen percent emerging markets. Something like that. Actually, let me double-check those allocations for you.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.633
SPEAKER_01: Emerging markets seem risky.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:13.940
SPEAKER_00: They are more volatile, but they're also cheaper on valuation metrics. Plus, when Canadian and US markets struggle, sometimes international does better.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.177
SPEAKER_01: Like a hedge?

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:29.724
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. In twenty twenty-two, Canadian stocks actually outperformed US stocks. International diversification helped Canadian investors that year.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.460
SPEAKER_01: What about bonds? I just have a broad Canadian bond index.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:50.900
SPEAKER_00: That's fine for the core holding. Though you might consider some US or global bonds for currency diversification. Maybe seventy percent Canadian, thirty percent international bonds.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.416
SPEAKER_01: Interest rates have been all over the place lately.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:06.401
SPEAKER_00: They have. Bond prices move inverse to rates, so when rates rise, bond prices fall. We've seen that this year.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.122
SPEAKER_01: So maybe bonds aren't great right now?

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:27.860
SPEAKER_00: Well, higher rates mean better yields going forward. A five percent bond yield is much more attractive than the two percent we had a few years ago.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.532
SPEAKER_01: But what if rates keep going up?

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:46.340
SPEAKER_00: Then bond prices would fall further. But remember, if you hold to maturity, you get your principal back. And you're earning higher coupons along the way.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.458
SPEAKER_01: What about different types of bonds?

00:07:53.180 --> 00:08:04.820
SPEAKER_00: You could mix government and corporate bonds. Maybe some inflation-protected bonds too. Real return bonds have done well when inflation's been high.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.060
SPEAKER_01: How much inflation protection do I need?

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:22.692
SPEAKER_00: Depends on your time horizon. Over thirty years, even modest inflation compounds significantly. Maybe ten to twenty percent of your bond allocation?

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.673
SPEAKER_01: What about alternatives? REITs, commodities, that stuff?

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:41.780
SPEAKER_00: They can add diversification, but they're generally more volatile than bonds. REITs are essentially real estate stocks - they move more like equities.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:47.820
SPEAKER_01: So they wouldn't help in a stock market crash?

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:56.678
SPEAKER_00: Not necessarily. In two thousand and eight, REITs fell almost as much as stocks. Though they've provided good income over time.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.996
SPEAKER_01: What about gold? Everyone talks about gold.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:18.740
SPEAKER_00: Gold can be a hedge against currency debasement and inflation. But it produces no income and can be very volatile. Maybe five percent maximum.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:24.780
SPEAKER_01: This is getting complicated. How do I keep track of all this?

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:33.455
SPEAKER_00: That's where target allocation comes in. You set percentage targets for each asset class, then rebalance periodically back to those targets.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.593
SPEAKER_01: How often should I rebalance?

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:55.700
SPEAKER_00: Quarterly or semi-annually is common. More frequent rebalancing can create tax issues in non-registered accounts. Less frequent and you drift too far from your targets.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.032
SPEAKER_01: What about taxes on rebalancing?

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:14.180
SPEAKER_00: In your RRSP and TFSA, no tax consequences. In taxable accounts, selling winners triggers capital gains. That's why many people rebalance with new contributions instead.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.061
SPEAKER_01: So add new money to whatever's underweight?

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:29.015
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. If stocks have done well and you're overweight, put new money into bonds until you're back on target.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.618
SPEAKER_01: What if I need to withdraw money?

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.408
SPEAKER_00: Take it from whatever's overweight. That way withdrawals also help with rebalancing.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.712
SPEAKER_01: This sounds like a lot of work.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:09.300
SPEAKER_00: It doesn't have to be. You could use a single balanced ETF like VBAL or VGRO. They do the rebalancing automatically.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.376
SPEAKER_01: What's the difference between those two?

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:27.100
SPEAKER_00: VBAL is sixty percent stocks, forty percent bonds. VGRO is eighty percent stocks, twenty percent bonds. Based on our discussion, VBAL might suit you better.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.565
SPEAKER_01: And it's all-in-one?

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.943
SPEAKER_00: Yep. Global diversification, automatic rebalancing, low fees. Takes the complexity out of portfolio management.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.213
SPEAKER_01: What are the fees?

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:58.735
SPEAKER_00: VBAL is... um... point two two percent annually, I think? Much cheaper than actively managed funds.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.048
SPEAKER_01: Versus what I have now?

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:19.299
SPEAKER_00: VTI and VCN are even cheaper - maybe point zero five percent each. But you have to do the rebalancing yourself.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.364
SPEAKER_01: Is the convenience worth the extra cost?

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:37.880
SPEAKER_00: That's personal preference. For many people, the automatic rebalancing and diversification is worth point one five percent annually.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:47.060
SPEAKER_01: What about during market crashes? Do these funds hold up?

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:59.500
SPEAKER_00: They'll still go down, but less than pure equity funds. In March twenty twenty, VBAL dropped about twenty percent versus thirty-five percent for stock funds.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.172
SPEAKER_01: That's still a lot.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:14.595
SPEAKER_00: It is, but it recovered much faster. By the end of twenty twenty, VBAL was actually positive for the year.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:24.020
SPEAKER_01: How do I know if I can handle a twenty percent drop?

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:36.460
SPEAKER_00: Think about it in dollar terms. If you have a hundred thousand invested, twenty percent is twenty thousand dollars. How would you feel seeing that loss?

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:41.379
SPEAKER_01: Sick to my stomach, but maybe not panicked?

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:50.561
SPEAKER_00: That sounds like you could handle it. The key is remembering it's temporary if you stay invested.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.887
SPEAKER_01: What about sequence of returns risk?

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:10.560
SPEAKER_00: That's more relevant when you're withdrawing money, like in retirement. Poor returns early on can really hurt if you're taking distributions.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.371
SPEAKER_01: But I'm still-- I'm still accumulating?

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:29.386
SPEAKER_00: Right, so market crashes actually help you. You're buying more shares at lower prices with each contribution.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.185
SPEAKER_01: I never thought of it that way.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:51.380
SPEAKER_00: It's counterintuitive, but true. The worst thing for someone your age would be markets going straight up until you retire, then crashing.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:57.420
SPEAKER_01: Because I'd have no chance to buy at lower prices?

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:04.194
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Some volatility along the way is actually helpful for long-term wealth building.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:15.900
SPEAKER_01: So maybe I should be less worried about short-term drops?

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:28.340
SPEAKER_00: As long as you're not planning to retire in the next five years, short-term volatility is just noise. It's the long-term trend that matters.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:34.380
SPEAKER_01: What about black swan events? Things we can't predict?

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:46.456
SPEAKER_00: By definition, you can't prepare for truly unforeseeable events. But diversification helps. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.113
SPEAKER_01: Geographic diversification too?

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:59.621
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely. If Canada goes through a prolonged recession, having US and international exposure helps.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.106
SPEAKER_01: What about sector diversification?

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:21.749
SPEAKER_00: Also important. Canadian markets are heavily weighted toward financials and resources. US markets give you more tech and healthcare exposure.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.823
SPEAKER_01: Should I be worried about currency risk?

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:37.719
SPEAKER_00: Some, but currency movements work both ways. A weak Canadian dollar actually helps your foreign investments.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.904
SPEAKER_01: And currency hedging?

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:56.269
SPEAKER_00: Reduces volatility but costs money and isn't perfect. For long-term investors, unhedged is often fine.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.974
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so what's my action plan?

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:15.396
SPEAKER_00: I'd suggest transitioning too something like VBAL gradually. Maybe sell a third of your current holdings each month over three months.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.033
SPEAKER_01: Why gradually?

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:33.133
SPEAKER_00: Reduces the risk of bad timing. You might sell everything right before a rally, or right before a crash.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.947
SPEAKER_01: Dollar cost averaging again?

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:51.724
SPEAKER_00: Right. It doesn't guarantee better results, but it eliminates the stress of trying to time the transition perfectly.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.840
SPEAKER_01: And then just stick with it?

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:12.875
SPEAKER_00: Pretty much. Review annually to make sure it still fits your situation, but avoid tinkering based on market movements.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.462
SPEAKER_01: This feels much more manageable.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:31.161
SPEAKER_00: Good. The best investment strategy is one you can stick with through all market conditions. Sounds like we found that for you.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:37.422
SPEAKER_01: Thanks for helping me think through this.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:46.220
SPEAKER_00: My pleasure. Better to adjust now than panic-sell during the next market crash.
