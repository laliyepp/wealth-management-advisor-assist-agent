WEBVTT

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.890
SPEAKER_00: Good afternoon, Mark. Ready to tackle retirement planning?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.809
SPEAKER_01: I think so. Though I'm not sure I'm-- I'm ready to actually retire yet.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:24.049
SPEAKER_00: That's fine - planning is about having options. You're forty-seven now, so we have time to adjust the strategy as things evolve.

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:31.279
SPEAKER_01: Right. I keep hearing I should aim for a million dollars, but that seems... daunting.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:44.019
SPEAKER_00: The magic number depends on your expected expenses. Let's start there - what do you think you'll spend annually in retirement?

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:51.779
SPEAKER_01: I have no idea. What I spend now? Less? I honestly haven't thought about it.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.398
SPEAKER_00: That's pretty common. What are you spending now, roughly?

00:01:05.453 --> 00:01:11.621
SPEAKER_01: Maybe seventy thousand a year? My mortgage will be paid off by then, so maybe sixty?

00:01:12.393 --> 00:01:21.843
SPEAKER_00: Good starting point. The rule of thumb is you need about seventy to eighty percent of pre-retirement income, but it varies a lot.

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:25.595
SPEAKER_01: Why seventy to eighty percent?

00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:42.060
SPEAKER_00: Well, you're no longer saving for retirement, your mortgage is gone, maybe lower transportation costs. But healthcare might cost more, and you'll have more time to spend money on hobbies.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.699
SPEAKER_01: So sixty thousand annually might be realistic?

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:59.217
SPEAKER_00: Could be. Now, let's look at your retirement income sources. In Canada, you'll have CPP, OAS, plus your own savings.

00:02:00.717 --> 00:02:04.213
SPEAKER_01: How much are CPP and OAS worth?

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:17.834
SPEAKER_00: CPP maxes out around fifteen thousand annually if you contribute the maximum for thirty-nine years. OAS is about seven thousand. Both indexed too inflation.

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:22.644
SPEAKER_01: So maybe twenty-two thousand from government sources?

00:02:23.444 --> 00:02:32.687
SPEAKER_00: That's if you qualify for the full amounts. CPP depends on your contribution history. What's your current income?

00:02:36.784 --> 00:02:39.211
SPEAKER_01: About ninety-five thousand.

00:02:41.784 --> 00:02:55.576
SPEAKER_00: Good, so you're contributing close to the CPP maximum. But you need to contribute for... let me think... most of your working career to get the full benefit.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:03:00.836
SPEAKER_01: I've been working steadily since I was twenty-two.

00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:13.056
SPEAKER_00: That helps. Though early years you probably weren't at the maximum. Let's assume you'll get about thirteen thousand from CPP.

00:03:13.856 --> 00:03:15.606
SPEAKER_01: And OAS is automatic?

00:03:19.746 --> 00:03:33.640
SPEAKER_00: If you're a Canadian resident for forty years after age eighteen. But it gets clawed back at higher income levels. Starts phasing out around... um... eighty thousand in retirement income, I think.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.109
SPEAKER_01: Would that affect me?

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:51.919
SPEAKER_00: Depends how much you accumulate. If you need sixty thousand annually and get twenty thousand from CPP and OAS, you need forty thousand from your own savings.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.226
SPEAKER_01: What's the four percent rule?

00:03:58.161 --> 00:04:10.611
SPEAKER_00: The idea that you can withdraw four percent of your portfolio annually without running out of money. So for forty thousand annually, you'd need a million dollars.

00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:13.694
SPEAKER_01: There's that million again.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:28.909
SPEAKER_00: It's not a magic number though. The four percent rule was based on US data and assumes a thirty-year retirement. Your situation might be different.

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:30.948
SPEAKER_01: Different how?

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:47.739
SPEAKER_00: Well, Canadians have CPP and OAS as a base. Plus our healthcare system. And maybe you'll work part-time in retirement, or your expenses will be lower than expected.

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:52.550
SPEAKER_01: What's your current portfolio worth?

00:04:54.679 --> 00:05:00.649
SPEAKER_00: Um, that was my question for you. What have you accumulated so far?

00:05:07.013 --> 00:05:12.539
SPEAKER_01: Right, sorry. RRSP has about two hundred thousand. TFSA maybe sixty.

00:05:13.543 --> 00:05:15.232
SPEAKER_00: Any employer pension?

00:05:19.123 --> 00:05:22.237
SPEAKER_01: Just a group RRSP with matching.

00:05:24.013 --> 00:05:26.369
SPEAKER_00: How much are you contributing annually?

00:05:34.547 --> 00:05:38.662
SPEAKER_01: About twelve thousand to the RRSP, six thousand to TFSA.

00:05:40.162 --> 00:05:43.421
SPEAKER_00: Good savings rate. What's the employer matching?

00:05:46.992 --> 00:05:54.138
SPEAKER_01: They match half of what I put in, up to three percent of salary.

00:05:55.638 --> 00:06:03.788
SPEAKER_00: So about three thousand annually in free money. That's huge - make sure you're getting the full match.

00:06:05.288 --> 00:06:08.958
SPEAKER_01: I am. So total savings is twenty-one thousand?

00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:17.399
SPEAKER_00: Right - twelve plus six plus three. That's over twenty percent of your gross income. Very strong savings rate.

00:06:24.646 --> 00:06:26.865
SPEAKER_01: But will it be enough?

00:06:30.693 --> 00:06:39.536
SPEAKER_00: Let's run the numbers. You have two sixty thousand now, saving twenty-one thousand annually, eighteen years until retirement at sixty-five.

00:06:44.583 --> 00:06:47.033
SPEAKER_01: What return should we assume?

00:06:50.803 --> 00:07:04.133
SPEAKER_00: Long-term, maybe six to seven percent nominal. Let's use six percent to be conservative. Your current balance grows to... let me calculate... about seven fifty thousand.

00:07:05.693 --> 00:07:07.819
SPEAKER_01: And the annual contributions?

00:07:11.353 --> 00:07:20.470
SPEAKER_00: Twenty-one thousand annually for eighteen years at six percent... that's another six hundred thousand or so. Total around one point three five million.

00:07:27.973 --> 00:07:31.643
SPEAKER_01: That's more than the million I thought I needed.

00:07:33.193 --> 00:07:45.108
SPEAKER_00: Right, and remember, that million was for forty thousand annually. At four percent, one point three five million supports fifty-four thousand in withdrawals.

00:07:47.844 --> 00:07:51.789
SPEAKER_01: Plus the twenty thousand from CPP and OAS?

00:07:54.827 --> 00:08:03.937
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. So you'd have over seventy thousand in retirement income. More than the sixty you thought you'd need.

00:08:05.717 --> 00:08:09.389
SPEAKER_01: That sounds... almost too good to be true.

00:08:11.487 --> 00:08:18.689
SPEAKER_00: Well, there are risks. Investment returns might be lower, inflation could be higher, you might live longer than expected.

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:26.813
SPEAKER_01: What if returns are only five percent?

00:08:30.267 --> 00:08:41.047
SPEAKER_00: Then you'd end up with maybe one point one million instead. Still enough for forty-four thousand annually, plus government benefits.

00:08:42.717 --> 00:08:44.080
SPEAKER_01: What about inflation?

00:08:49.487 --> 00:09:00.937
SPEAKER_00: That's why we use real returns - returns above inflation. But you're right to worry. If inflation averages three percent, sixty thousand today equals about a hundred thousand in eighteen years.

00:09:02.717 --> 00:09:07.039
SPEAKER_01: So I might need more than I thought?

00:09:09.327 --> 00:09:16.666
SPEAKER_00: Maybe. But your investments should grow with inflation too. And CPP and OAS are indexed, so they maintain purchasing power.

00:09:22.717 --> 00:09:24.816
SPEAKER_01: What about healthcare costs?

00:09:28.487 --> 00:09:39.937
SPEAKER_00: Canada's system covers most basics, but you might want private insurance for things like prescription drugs, dental, vision. Maybe two thousand annually?

00:09:41.717 --> 00:09:43.781
SPEAKER_01: That's not too bad.

00:09:47.327 --> 00:09:54.989
SPEAKER_00: No, we're lucky that way. In the US, retirees spend fifteen to twenty thousand annually on healthcare.

00:10:00.717 --> 00:10:03.292
SPEAKER_01: What about long-term care?

00:10:06.487 --> 00:10:17.937
SPEAKER_00: That's less predictable. Home care or assisted living can be expensive. Maybe budget five hundred thousand for potential long-term care needs.

00:10:19.717 --> 00:10:22.473
SPEAKER_01: Half a million? That's a lot.

00:10:24.327 --> 00:10:33.547
SPEAKER_00: You might not need it, but it's good to plan for the possibility. That's where your home equity could help.

00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:38.987
SPEAKER_01: I hadn't thought about the house.

00:10:39.987 --> 00:10:46.564
SPEAKER_00: Many retirees downsize and use the proceeds to fund retirement. What's your house worth?

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.398
SPEAKER_01: About six hundred thousand now.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:09.351
SPEAKER_00: So that's significant wealth beyond your investment accounts. If you downsize to a four hundred thousand place, that's two hundred thousand extra for retirement.

00:11:10.851 --> 00:11:14.621
SPEAKER_01: I'd hate to leave the neighborhood though.

00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:23.869
SPEAKER_00: You don't have to decide now. The point is you have options. The house is like a backup plan.

00:11:28.851 --> 00:11:32.717
SPEAKER_01: What about retiring earlier than sixty-five?

00:11:33.961 --> 00:11:46.078
SPEAKER_00: That's trickier. You can't get CPP until sixty, OAS until sixty-five. So you'd need to bridge that gap with your own savings.

00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:50.361
SPEAKER_01: How much extra would I need?

00:11:53.848 --> 00:12:03.647
SPEAKER_00: If you retired at sixty, you'd need five years of expenses before any government benefits. Maybe three hundred thousand extra.

00:12:06.663 --> 00:12:09.879
SPEAKER_01: That seems doable if I keep saving.

00:12:11.773 --> 00:12:21.502
SPEAKER_00: It might be. Though early CPP comes at a penalty - about point six percent per month before age sixty-five.

00:12:24.663 --> 00:12:29.103
SPEAKER_01: So thirty-six percent less if I take it at sixty?

00:12:30.933 --> 00:12:38.622
SPEAKER_00: Right, permanently. Though if you're not working, you might prefer some income over no income.

00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:46.976
SPEAKER_01: What about working part-time in retirement?

00:12:48.869 --> 00:12:57.999
SPEAKER_00: That's becoming very common. Even fifteen thousand annually from part-time work makes a big difference to your financial security.

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:06.529
SPEAKER_01: And it might be more fulfilling than full retirement.

00:13:07.529 --> 00:13:16.529
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Many people find complete retirement boring. A consulting gig or part-time role can provide purpose and income.

00:13:20.897 --> 00:13:23.495
SPEAKER_01: What about tax planning in retirement?

00:13:27.694 --> 00:13:38.914
SPEAKER_00: That's crucial. You'll likely be in a lower tax bracket, so withdrawing from RRSPs becomes more attractive than when you were working.

00:13:40.584 --> 00:13:44.646
SPEAKER_01: Should I convert RRSPs to RRIFs right away?

00:13:47.354 --> 00:13:57.804
SPEAKER_00: You have to by age seventy-one. But you might want to do it earlier to start the income splitting with your spouse.

00:13:59.584 --> 00:14:00.714
SPEAKER_01: Income splitting?

00:14:04.694 --> 00:14:14.496
SPEAKER_00: After age sixty-five, you can split eligible pension income - including RRIF withdrawals - with your spouse. Helps minimize total taxes.

00:14:18.311 --> 00:14:22.465
SPEAKER_01: My wife has her own retirement savings though.

00:14:25.081 --> 00:14:30.775
SPEAKER_00: Even better. You can optimize withdrawals from both accounts to stay in lower tax brackets.

00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:40.603
SPEAKER_01: This is getting complicated.

00:14:44.421 --> 00:14:54.111
SPEAKER_00: It can be. That's why many retirees work with accountants or fee-for-service planners to optimize their withdrawal strategies.

00:14:57.607 --> 00:14:59.873
SPEAKER_01: What about OAS clawback?

00:15:04.377 --> 00:15:14.827
SPEAKER_00: If your net income exceeds about eighty-one thousand, you start losing OAS. At one hundred thirty thousand, it's completely gone.

00:15:16.607 --> 00:15:20.535
SPEAKER_01: So I want to stay under eighty-one thousand?

00:15:22.217 --> 00:15:32.953
SPEAKER_00: It's something to consider. Though don't let the tax tail wag the investment dog. Better to have higher income and pay some clawback.

00:15:35.453 --> 00:15:38.180
SPEAKER_01: What about leaving money to kids?

00:15:42.223 --> 00:15:52.673
SPEAKER_00: That changes the calculation entirely. If you want to leave an inheritance, you need to save more or spend less.

00:15:54.453 --> 00:16:02.412
SPEAKER_01: I'd like to leave them something, but not at the expense of my own security.

00:16:03.912 --> 00:16:14.632
SPEAKER_00: That's wise. The best gift to your kids is not being a financial burden. If there's money left over, that's a bonus.

00:16:17.302 --> 00:16:21.709
SPEAKER_01: What's my biggest risk in retirement planning?

00:16:23.072 --> 00:16:33.523
SPEAKER_00: Longevity risk - living longer than expected. A sixty-five-year-old male has a decent chance of living to ninety.

00:16:35.023 --> 00:16:37.404
SPEAKER_01: Twenty-five years of retirement?

00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:47.911
SPEAKER_00: Or more. That's why the four percent rule assumes thirty years. Your money needs to last a long time.

00:16:53.443 --> 00:16:57.227
SPEAKER_01: What if I run out of money?

00:16:59.213 --> 00:17:10.171
SPEAKER_00: Well, you'd still have CPP and OAS. Plus your house could be sold or mortgaged. And there are government supports for low-income seniors.

00:17:11.671 --> 00:17:15.507
SPEAKER_01: Not exactly the retirement I'm picturing.

00:17:18.281 --> 00:17:29.001
SPEAKER_00: Right, that's why we plan. The projections show you should be fine if you stick to your current savings rate.

00:17:30.671 --> 00:17:34.441
SPEAKER_01: What if I want to retire earlier?

00:17:35.241 --> 00:17:46.891
SPEAKER_00: Then you might need to save more now, or plan for part-time income, or accept a more modest lifestyle in early retirement.

00:17:48.671 --> 00:17:52.658
SPEAKER_01: How much more would I need to save?

00:17:54.281 --> 00:18:03.146
SPEAKER_00: For retirement at sixty? Maybe another five thousand annually. That's achievable if you get raises or bonuses.

00:18:06.671 --> 00:18:11.056
SPEAKER_01: Or if I can increase my TFSA contributions.

00:18:12.441 --> 00:18:18.892
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. The contribution room increases each year, so you'll have more flexibility as time goes on.

00:18:24.423 --> 00:18:29.801
SPEAKER_01: This has been really helpful. I feel much more confident about retirement.

00:18:30.033 --> 00:18:40.753
SPEAKER_00: Good. The key is starting early and being consistent. You're on track for a comfortable retirement if you stick with the plan.

00:18:42.423 --> 00:18:45.409
SPEAKER_01: And I have options if things change.

00:18:49.413 --> 00:18:55.863
SPEAKER_00: Right. That's the beauty of planning ahead - you maintain flexibility to adjust as life happens.
