WEBVTT

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.890
SPEAKER_00: Good afternoon, Michael. Thanks for coming in today.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.552
SPEAKER_01: Thanks for seeing me. I've been, uh-- I've been really stressed about my taxes lately.

00:00:14.052 --> 00:00:23.792
SPEAKER_00: I can imagine. Tax season's coming up fast. So you mentioned on the phone you're making about... what was it... eighty-five thousand this year?

00:00:24.692 --> 00:00:28.475
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, eighty-seven actually. Got a raise in June.

00:00:29.322 --> 00:00:40.762
SPEAKER_00: Great. So that puts you in the... um... let me think... the thirty-three percent combined bracket here in Ontario. Federal plus provincial. Actually, let me double-check that rate.

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:44.945
SPEAKER_01: Thirty-three percent? That sounds brutal.

00:00:46.322 --> 00:00:59.696
SPEAKER_00: Well, marginal rate. Your average tax rate is lower, but yeah, every extra dollar you earn gets hit pretty hard. That's why RRSP contributions are so powerful at your income level.

00:01:00.196 --> 00:01:03.364
SPEAKER_01: How much room do I have left?

00:01:04.136 --> 00:01:18.344
SPEAKER_00: Good question. Your contribution room is eighteen percent of last year's income, up to the annual limit. So on eighty-seven thousand, that's... um... fifteen thousand six hundred.

00:01:19.844 --> 00:01:23.622
SPEAKER_01: But I already contributed eight thousand this year.

00:01:25.122 --> 00:01:36.221
SPEAKER_00: Right, so you've got about seven thousand six hundred left. Plus any unused room from previous years. Um, do you have your Notice of Assessment handy?

00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:42.031
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, here it is. Says I have... eleven thousand in unused room.

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:53.378
SPEAKER_00: Perfect. So you could contribute up to eighteen thousand six hundred total this year. That would save you... let's see... about six thousand in taxes.

00:01:54.878 --> 00:01:57.134
SPEAKER_01: Six thousand? That's huge.

00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:08.995
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Though you want to make sure you have the cash flow to handle that. What's your monthly take-home after deductions?

00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:14.805
SPEAKER_01: About fifty-two hundred. Rent's twenty-two hundred.

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:30.145
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so you've got some room. Even if you could do an extra five hundred-- sorry, five hundred a month to your RRSP, that's another six thousand annually. Actually, wait... let me recalculate. Five hundred times twelve is...

00:02:30.945 --> 00:02:32.679
SPEAKER_01: Six thousand, yeah.

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:47.737
SPEAKER_00: Right. And at your tax rate, that saves you about two thousand-- two thousand in taxes. Plus the money grows tax-deferred until you retire. What's your current RRSP invested in?

00:02:49.237 --> 00:02:52.997
SPEAKER_01: Just sitting in a savings account earning nothing.

00:02:53.797 --> 00:03:02.217
SPEAKER_00: Ouch. Even high-interest savings accounts are only paying around four percent now. You're missing out on growth potential.

00:03:03.017 --> 00:03:07.107
SPEAKER_01: I don't know much about investing. Seems risky.

00:03:07.907 --> 00:03:23.801
SPEAKER_00: I get that. But at thirty-two, you've got over thirty years until retirement. Even conservative portfolios have averaged... what... six to seven percent historically? Let me... I should verify those numbers, but that's, uh, that's about right.

00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:28.517
SPEAKER_01: What kind of investments are we talking about?

00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:42.080
SPEAKER_00: For RRSPs, I usually recommend a mix. Maybe sixty percent Canadian equity, twenty percent US, ten percent international, ten percent bonds. All through low-cost ETFs.

00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:45.928
SPEAKER_01: Canadian equity? Like individual stocks?

00:03:48.322 --> 00:03:58.772
SPEAKER_00: No, more like VTI... wait, that's US. For Canada, something like VCN - Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index. Gives you exposure to-- to all the big Canadian companies.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:03.450
SPEAKER_01: So like Shopify, Royal Bank, that stuff?

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:14.218
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Royal Bank's been a dividend aristocrat for... what... decades? Shopify's more volatile but good growth potential.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.700
SPEAKER_01: What about my TFSA? I've barely touched that.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:34.900
SPEAKER_00: That's actually a bigger missed opportunity. TFSA room accumulates from the year you turn eighteen. You're thirty-two, so... um... let me calculate. Six thousand a year since twenty-oh-nine, but the limits changed...

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.040
SPEAKER_01: My CRA account says I have forty-three thousand in room.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:57.674
SPEAKER_00: Wow, okay. So you've barely used it. TFSA is actually better than RRSP for some things because withdrawals are tax-free. No minimum withdrawals either, unlike RRIFs. Or is it RRSPs that convert to RRIFs? I always... I always mix that up.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:02.700
SPEAKER_01: What should I prioritize - RRSP or TFSA?

00:05:03.704 --> 00:05:17.484
SPEAKER_00: Good question. At your income level, RRSP probably makes more sense for the immediate tax break. But TFSA is great for shorter-term goals or if you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket in retirement.

00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:21.807
SPEAKER_01: Higher tax bracket in retirement?

00:05:23.174 --> 00:05:37.208
SPEAKER_00: Well, if tax rates go up generally, or if you have a good pension plus CPP plus OAS, you might not drop down tax brackets as much as you'd expect. Actually, let me... let me look up current CPP projections.

00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:41.823
SPEAKER_01: I don't have a pension at work.

00:05:43.323 --> 00:05:50.788
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so you'll rely more on your own savings. That actually tilts toward RRSP being better.

00:05:52.288 --> 00:05:56.425
SPEAKER_01: What if I split it? Half RRSP, half TFSA?

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:10.679
SPEAKER_00: That's not a bad hedge. Maybe do the RRSP first for the immediate tax savings, then focus on TFSA. Or do both simultaneously if you can swing it.

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:16.258
SPEAKER_01: How much should I realistically be saving total?

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:35.660
SPEAKER_00: Rule of thumb is ten to fifteen percent of gross income for retirement. On eighty-seven thousand, that's... uh... eight to thirteen thousand annually. You're doing eight in RRSP, so you're at the low end.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.707
SPEAKER_01: Could I bump it to twelve thousand without killing my lifestyle?

00:06:43.207 --> 00:06:53.317
SPEAKER_00: That's four thousand more, so about three hundred thirty a month. Sounds doable given your take-home. Would save you another, um, thirteen hundred in taxes.

00:06:55.097 --> 00:06:58.867
SPEAKER_01: So I'd net about twenty-seven hundred more savings?

00:07:00.317 --> 00:07:08.647
SPEAKER_00: Right, because of the tax refund. It's like the government subsidizing your retirement savings at your tax rate.

00:07:10.207 --> 00:07:13.399
SPEAKER_01: When would I get that refund?

00:07:15.867 --> 00:07:30.530
SPEAKER_00: If you file in March, probably by May or June. Though you could adjust your payroll deductions to get it throughout the year instead. Actually, let me verify how that works with CRA.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.700
SPEAKER_01: I'd rather just get the lump sum.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:49.401
SPEAKER_00: Fair enough. Many people prefer that. You could even contribute that refund to next year's RRSP. Creates a nice... a nice cycle - contribution, refund, bigger contribution.

00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:56.384
SPEAKER_01: What about timing? Should I wait until the end of the tax year?

00:07:57.884 --> 00:08:10.994
SPEAKER_00: Actually no. You have until... um... March first of the following year to contribute for the current tax year. But the sooner you contribute, the more time your money has to grow.

00:08:11.774 --> 00:08:15.931
SPEAKER_01: Time in the market versus timing the market?

00:08:17.544 --> 00:08:24.324
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Even if the market drops after you contribute, you've got decades to recover.

00:08:25.994 --> 00:08:30.016
SPEAKER_01: What about borrowing to invest in my RRSP?

00:08:32.324 --> 00:08:44.465
SPEAKER_00: RRSP loans can make sense if you don't have the cash. Interest rates are around... what... seven percent now? But you get the tax refund to help pay it down.

00:08:45.965 --> 00:08:48.907
SPEAKER_01: Sounds risky borrowing to invest.

00:08:51.735 --> 00:09:05.676
SPEAKER_00: It's definitely more aggressive. I'd only consider it if you're confident in your job security and can handle the monthly payments even if the market drops.

00:09:07.176 --> 00:09:10.977
SPEAKER_01: I think I'll stick to cash contributions.

00:09:12.786 --> 00:09:21.455
SPEAKER_00: Probably smart. Building good savings habits is more important than maximizing every dollar. What about other tax strategies?

00:09:22.176 --> 00:09:23.422
SPEAKER_01: Like what?

00:09:26.946 --> 00:09:35.396
SPEAKER_00: Well, are you claiming all your eligible deductions? Medical expenses, professional dues, union fees if you have them?

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:41.726
SPEAKER_01: I don't think I have much. Maybe dental bills?

00:09:42.786 --> 00:09:54.506
SPEAKER_00: Medical expenses are only deductible above... um... three percent of income or... is it twenty-four hundred? Whatever's less. Let me double-check those thresholds for you.

00:09:56.176 --> 00:09:59.375
SPEAKER_01: So probably not worth it then.

00:10:00.946 --> 00:10:08.396
SPEAKER_00: Probably not. What about charitable donations? Those have better tax treatment - federal and provincial credits.

00:10:10.176 --> 00:10:14.679
SPEAKER_01: I donate maybe two hundred to United Way through work.

00:10:14.786 --> 00:10:23.006
SPEAKER_00: That'll get you back about... what... sixty to eighty bucks? Not huge, but every bit helps.

00:10:24.676 --> 00:10:28.446
SPEAKER_01: What about income splitting with my girlfriend?

00:10:29.446 --> 00:10:41.139
SPEAKER_00: Ah, well, you'd need to be married or common-law first. Are you considered common-law? That's usually twelve months living together, but I should... should verify the exact rules.

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:46.172
SPEAKER_01: We've been together three years, living together two.

00:10:46.249 --> 00:10:53.466
SPEAKER_00: Then you probably qualify. Income splitting opportunities are limited though - pension splitting, spousal RRSPs. What's her income situation like?

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:03.080
SPEAKER_01: She makes about forty-five thousand, lower tax bracket.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:13.530
SPEAKER_00: Interesting. You could do spousal RRSP contributions. You get the deduction, but the money's in her name for withdrawl later.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.671
SPEAKER_01: How does that help?

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:31.537
SPEAKER_00: When you both retire, ideally you'd have similar incomes, keeping you both in lower tax brackets instead of you having all the income in a high bracket.

00:11:33.037 --> 00:11:37.352
SPEAKER_01: That's pretty far ahead to be planning.

00:11:39.307 --> 00:11:45.555
SPEAKER_00: True, but tax planning really is long-term thinking. The decisions you make now compound over decades.

00:11:50.122 --> 00:11:52.838
SPEAKER_01: What about investing outside registered accounts?

00:11:55.232 --> 00:12:03.424
SPEAKER_00: That gets into capital gains and dividend taxation. Canadian dividends get preferential treatment - dividend tax credit makes them more efficient than interest income.

00:12:09.122 --> 00:12:11.544
SPEAKER_01: So Canadian bank stocks?

00:12:14.392 --> 00:12:27.718
SPEAKER_00: Could be part of the mix. Royal Bank yields about four percent, but you pay tax on those dividends annually. Capital gains are only taxed when you sell, and only fifty percent is taxable.

00:12:29.218 --> 00:12:33.898
SPEAKER_01: Sounds complicated. Maybe I should just focus on registered accounts first.

00:12:34.328 --> 00:12:41.548
SPEAKER_00: That's probably smart. Max out your RRSP and TFSA room before worrying about taxable accounts.

00:12:43.218 --> 00:12:47.988
SPEAKER_01: How should I actually implement this? All at once?

00:12:48.988 --> 00:13:03.856
SPEAKER_00: I'd suggest starting with bumping your monthly RRSP contribution by that three hundred we talked about. Then maybe use your tax refund to contribute to TFSA next year. Baby steps.

00:13:05.356 --> 00:13:10.195
SPEAKER_01: And invest it all in those ETFs you mentioned?

00:13:12.153 --> 00:13:22.373
SPEAKER_00: Start simple. Maybe a balanced ETF like VBAL - sixty percent stocks, forty percent bonds. Or VGRO if you want more aggressive - eighty-twenty split.

00:13:24.043 --> 00:13:27.105
SPEAKER_01: What's the difference in returns?

00:13:29.813 --> 00:13:39.263
SPEAKER_00: Historically, more stocks means higher returns but more volatility. VGRO might average eight percent long-term, VBAL maybe seven.

00:13:41.043 --> 00:13:44.593
SPEAKER_01: I think I can handle the extra volatility.

00:13:45.153 --> 00:14:04.171
SPEAKER_00: At thirty-two, probably. You've got time to ride out the ups and downs. Just don't panic-sell if we hit a bear market. Actually, let me... let me send you some reading on behavioral investing.

00:14:05.671 --> 00:14:09.311
SPEAKER_01: This all sounds good. What about fees?

00:14:11.441 --> 00:14:21.891
SPEAKER_00: VGRO has an expense ratio of... um... point two five percent, I think? Much cheaper than mutual funds, which can charge two percent or more.

00:14:23.671 --> 00:14:27.193
SPEAKER_01: Two percent doesn't sound like much.

00:14:28.781 --> 00:14:41.467
SPEAKER_00: Over thirty years, the difference between point two five and two percent fees is... massive. Like, forty percent less wealth at retirement. Fees really compound against you.

00:14:42.967 --> 00:14:46.062
SPEAKER_01: Wow, okay, low fees it is.

00:14:48.737 --> 00:15:00.908
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. John Bogle used to say 'you get what you don't pay for' in investing. Lower fees mean more money stays in your pocket.

00:15:02.408 --> 00:15:06.336
SPEAKER_01: When should we meet again to review progress?

00:15:08.018 --> 00:15:17.754
SPEAKER_00: Maybe in six months? That'll give you time to implement the changes and see how the new contribution amounts feel budget-wise.

00:15:19.254 --> 00:15:22.341
SPEAKER_01: And you'll send me those ETF details?

00:15:25.024 --> 00:15:34.474
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely. I'll put together a summary with the ticker symbols, expense ratios, and a simple implementation plan.

00:15:36.254 --> 00:15:40.329
SPEAKER_01: This has been really helpful. I feel less stressed already.

00:15:41.864 --> 00:15:51.989
SPEAKER_00: Good! Having a plan makes all the difference. Tax optimization isn't sexy, but it's one of the best returns on investment you can get.

00:15:52.254 --> 00:15:56.024
SPEAKER_01: Guaranteed thirty-three percent return on RRSP contributions.

00:15:57.024 --> 00:16:04.475
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Plus the long-term growth. Your future self will thank you for starting now.

00:16:05.975 --> 00:16:09.525
SPEAKER_01: Alright, time to adult with my finances.

00:16:10.585 --> 00:16:17.895
SPEAKER_00: Ha! That's the spirit. And remember, you don't have to be perfect. Progress over perfection.

00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:25.198
SPEAKER_01: Thanks again. I'll be in touch once I get started.

00:16:26.698 --> 00:16:33.656
SPEAKER_00: Sounds great. And don't hesitate to call if you have questions. This stuff can be overwhelming at first.

00:16:35.156 --> 00:16:39.222
SPEAKER_01: Will do. Have a good rest of your week.

00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:43.486
SPEAKER_00: You too. And good luck with the tax optimization!
