WEBVTT

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.890
SPEAKER_00: Good morning, uh, thanks for coming in today.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.899
SPEAKER_01: Morning, thanks for fitting me in on such short notice.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:19.220
SPEAKER_00: Of course. So I've been reviewing your portfolio that you sent over, and um, there's definitely some things we should... we should discuss here.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.009
SPEAKER_01: Okay, what's the damage?

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:36.890
SPEAKER_00: Well, it's not damage exactly, but you've got about... um... seventy-two percent in tech stocks, which is... that's pretty concentrated, Sarah. Actually, let me double-check that number.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.650
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, they've been killing it though. My Apple stock is up like fourty percent this year.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:57.824
SPEAKER_00: Right, and that's great, but what happens if the tech sector takes a hit? Remember twenty-twenty... or was it twenty-two when the NASDAQ dropped... uh... thirty-three percent? I think that's right.

00:00:59.324 --> 00:01:02.492
SPEAKER_01: Ugh, don't remind me. That was brutal.

00:01:03.264 --> 00:01:10.714
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. So with your current allocation, if tech drops twenty percent, your whole portfolio could be down fourteen, fifteen percent.

00:01:11.554 --> 00:01:16.332
SPEAKER_01: Wow, I hadn't done that math. That's... that's a lot.

00:01:17.832 --> 00:01:29.931
SPEAKER_00: It is. So let's talk diversification. What's your timeline here? When do you think you'll need this money? For retirement versus... well, other goals.

00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:36.741
SPEAKER_01: Well, I'm thirty-four, so retirement's still like thirty years away, but...

00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:50.088
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so long-term. But you mentioned you might want to buy a house in the next few years, right? That was... that was in your email, I think.

00:01:51.588 --> 00:01:58.791
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, maybe in three to five years. I've got about fifty thousand saved up for that.

00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:11.705
SPEAKER_00: Good. So that money should probably be in something safer. What about the rest? You've got, what, about... let me see... two hundred thousand in your investment account? Is that right?

00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:17.515
SPEAKER_01: Two-ten, actually. It's been a good year.

00:02:18.315 --> 00:02:36.855
SPEAKER_00: Nice. Okay, so for that long-term money, I'd suggest something like, um... let me think... forty percent US stocks, twenty percent international, thirty percent bonds, ten percent alternatives. Actually, let me... let me double-check those percentages later. I want to make sure that's optimal for your age.

00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:40.389
SPEAKER_01: Alternatives? You mean like crypto?

00:02:41.655 --> 00:02:57.447
SPEAKER_00: Ha, no. More like REITs - Real Estate Investment Trusts. They've been yielding around... um... four to five percent lately. Or was it four to six? I should look that up to be sure.

00:02:58.947 --> 00:03:01.707
SPEAKER_01: That doesn't sound very exciting.

00:03:02.507 --> 00:03:10.927
SPEAKER_00: Maybe not, but REITs have had negative correlation with tech stocks about sixty percent of the time over the last decade. Good hedge.

00:03:11.727 --> 00:03:16.817
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I can see that. What about international? Which countries?

00:03:17.617 --> 00:03:35.511
SPEAKER_00: I'd go with a broad index. Maybe VTI for international developed markets. Or wait, was that VTIAX? Let me... um... let me double check that. Europe's been undervalued compared to the US, I think.

00:03:37.011 --> 00:03:39.227
SPEAKER_01: How undervalued? Like, numbers-wise?

00:03:41.751 --> 00:03:49.790
SPEAKER_00: Well, the P/E ratio on European stocks is around, um, thirteen I think versus twenty-five for the S&P 500.

00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:53.532
SPEAKER_01: So almost half the price for the same earnings?

00:03:55.032 --> 00:04:02.482
SPEAKER_00: Roughly, yeah. Of course, there are reasons for that - slower growth, regulatory issues, but still...

00:04:03.282 --> 00:04:07.160
SPEAKER_01: Interesting. What about bonds? Interest rates are crazy right now.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:16.780
SPEAKER_00: They are. Ten-year treasuries are at what, four point seven percent? Haven't seen that since two thousand seven.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.410
SPEAKER_01: So that's actually not bad for safe money now.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:36.610
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Though with your timeline, I'd maybe do a mix. Some short-term for stability, some longer duration for if-- for when rates drop. If they drop.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.750
SPEAKER_01: What do you think? Are rates gonna keep going up?

00:04:43.550 --> 00:05:01.384
SPEAKER_00: Honestly? Fed funs is at five and a quarter now. I think we're near the peak, but... uh... who knows with inflation, you know? It's... it's really hard to predict these things.

00:05:02.884 --> 00:05:06.410
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, my grocery bill is still insane.

00:05:07.414 --> 00:05:15.194
SPEAKER_00: Tell me about it. Core CPI was three point two last month, still above the Fed's two percent target.

00:05:15.994 --> 00:05:20.084
SPEAKER_01: So what does that mean for my investments?

00:05:20.884 --> 00:05:34.918
SPEAKER_00: Well, if inflation stays high, stocks usually do okay long-term, but bonds get hurt. Real estate often does-- sorry, my phone's buzzing. Anyway, real estate often does well. At least that's... that's the theory.

00:05:36.418 --> 00:05:39.533
SPEAKER_01: So I should-- oh, sorry, go ahead.

00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:46.313
SPEAKER_01: Hence the REITs recommendation. Right, that makes-- that makes sense now.

00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:55.604
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Plus, with your age, you can handle some volatility. The key is not putting all your eggs in one basket.

00:05:57.104 --> 00:06:03.254
SPEAKER_01: Okay, so if I rebalance, what kind of returns are we talking about?

00:06:04.754 --> 00:06:11.424
SPEAKER_00: Historically, a balanced portfolio like that has averaged around eight to nine percent annually over long periods.

00:06:13.204 --> 00:06:15.151
SPEAKER_01: Versus my tech-heavy portfolio?

00:06:17.974 --> 00:06:27.612
SPEAKER_00: Well, tech's been averaging twelve to fifteen percent, but with way more ups and downs. Two thousand was brutal for tech investors.

00:06:29.112 --> 00:06:34.659
SPEAKER_01: Right, the dot-com crash. Before my time, but I've heard stories.

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:42.269
SPEAKER_00: NASDAQ dropped seventy-eight percent from peak to trough. Took fifteen years to recover.

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:46.819
SPEAKER_01: Jesus. Okay, diversification it is.

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:54.599
SPEAKER_00: Good. Now, let's talk about tax efficiency. Are you maxing out your 401k?

00:06:56.159 --> 00:07:00.379
SPEAKER_01: I'm putting in eight percent. Company matches up to six.

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:14.939
SPEAKER_00: So you're getting the full match, that's good. But the limit this year is twenty-two five. You could be saving a lot more on taxes.

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:19.109
SPEAKER_01: How much more are we talking?

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:35.810
SPEAKER_00: Well, you're making about ninety thousand, right? So you're in the... uh... twenty-two percent bracket. Every dollar you contribute saves you twenty-two cents. Or is it twenty-four? I always mix those up.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:49.793
SPEAKER_01: So if I maxed it out, I'd save... what, like five thousand in-- wait, is that... is that right? I'm not good with tax math.

00:07:51.293 --> 00:07:57.403
SPEAKER_00: More like three thousand, since you're already contributing some. But yeah, substantial savings.

00:07:59.183 --> 00:08:02.953
SPEAKER_01: That's like a free vacation every year.

00:08:03.953 --> 00:08:10.733
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Plus, the money grows tax-deferred. Compound interest is powerful over thirty years.

00:08:12.403 --> 00:08:14.425
SPEAKER_01: What about Roth IRAs?

00:08:16.733 --> 00:08:23.513
SPEAKER_00: Good question. At your income, you can still contribute the full six thousand. The question is traditional versus Roth.

00:08:25.183 --> 00:08:27.125
SPEAKER_01: What's the difference again?

00:08:29.953 --> 00:08:36.403
SPEAKER_00: Traditional gives you a tax deduction now, but you pay taxes when you withdraw. Roth is the opposite.

00:08:38.183 --> 00:08:39.984
SPEAKER_01: So which is better?

00:08:42.793 --> 00:08:50.462
SPEAKER_00: Depends if you think your tax rate will be hire or lower in retirement. With the way government spending is going...

00:08:51.183 --> 00:08:54.533
SPEAKER_01: You think taxes are going up?

00:08:55.953 --> 00:09:02.403
SPEAKER_00: Hard to say, but the current tax cuts expire in twenty twenty-five. Plus, Social Security needs funding.

00:09:04.183 --> 00:09:07.733
SPEAKER_01: Good point. Maybe I should hedge my bets?

00:09:08.793 --> 00:09:15.513
SPEAKER_00: Smart thinking. Maybe traditional 401k for the immediate tax break, Roth IRA for tax-free growth.

00:09:17.183 --> 00:09:20.953
SPEAKER_01: That makes sense. Best of both worlds.

00:09:21.953 --> 00:09:28.403
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Now, about that house down payment money. Fifty thousand in cash?

00:09:30.183 --> 00:09:35.686
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, just sitting in a savings account earning... well, basically nothing.

00:09:35.793 --> 00:09:42.013
SPEAKER_00: Well, not nothing. High-yield savings are paying around four point five percent now.

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:47.453
SPEAKER_01: Really? Mine's paying like point one percent.

00:09:48.453 --> 00:10:01.146
SPEAKER_00: Time to shop around. Marcus, Ally, Capital One are all competitive. FDIC insured up to... um... two fifty, I believe. Or is it two fifty per account? I should... let me verify that.

00:10:02.646 --> 00:10:07.179
SPEAKER_01: That's like two thousand more per year just for switching banks.

00:10:07.256 --> 00:10:15.817
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Or you could do CDs if you know you won't need the money for a few years. Some are paying over five percent.

00:10:17.317 --> 00:10:21.087
SPEAKER_01: Isn't that better than bonds then?

00:10:22.087 --> 00:10:28.537
SPEAKER_00: For now, yes. But CDs are fixed rate. If inflation drops and rates fall, bonds could appreciate.

00:10:30.317 --> 00:10:33.867
SPEAKER_01: This is getting... this is getting complicated.

00:10:34.427 --> 00:10:47.544
SPEAKER_00: I know, sorry. The main thing is getting out of that tech concentration. Everything else we can-- we can fine-tune over time. Does that... does that make sense to you?

00:10:49.044 --> 00:10:51.359
SPEAKER_01: So what's the first step?

00:10:53.314 --> 00:11:02.629
SPEAKER_00: I'd suggest selling about sixty thousand of your tech holdings. That'll get you down to fifty percent, which is more reasonable.

00:11:04.129 --> 00:11:07.679
SPEAKER_01: Won't I owe a lot in capital gains?

00:11:08.239 --> 00:11:16.159
SPEAKER_00: Some, yeah. Long-term capital gains rate is fifteen percent for your income level. But it's worth it for the diversification.

00:11:17.129 --> 00:11:19.569
SPEAKER_01: So like nine thousand in taxes?

00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:37.725
SPEAKER_00: Depends on your cost basis. If you bought Apple at a hundred and it's at one-ninety, you'd owe tax on the ninety dollar gain. Simple math, but... but people forget about this. The IRS doesn't, though.

00:11:39.225 --> 00:11:43.905
SPEAKER_01: Most of my stuff I bought pretty recently, so not huge gains.

00:11:44.335 --> 00:11:50.555
SPEAKER_00: Good, that helps. You could also harvest some losses if you have any to offset the gains.

00:11:52.225 --> 00:11:55.995
SPEAKER_01: I think I have some losers from last year.

00:11:56.995 --> 00:12:13.863
SPEAKER_00: Perfect. Bring me your statements and we can map out a tax-efficient rebalancing strategy. I'll need to... let me think... probably need to look up the current tax lost harvesting rules too. Actually, did those change this year? I should verify.

00:12:15.363 --> 00:12:20.660
SPEAKER_01: This all sounds good, but I'm worried about timing the market.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:28.380
SPEAKER_00: Understandable. We could do it gradually. Maybe sell twenty thousand a month over three months?

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.112
SPEAKER_01: That sounds less scary.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:41.270
SPEAKER_00: Dollar-cost averaging works both ways. Sometimes you'll sell high, sometimes low, but it averages out.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.600
SPEAKER_01: And where would we put the money?

00:12:47.160 --> 00:13:05.277
SPEAKER_00: I'm thinking VTI for total stock market, VTIAX for international, BND for bonds, and VNQ for REITs. Actually, wait... is it VNQ or VNQI? Let me... let me double-check those ticker symbols before our next meeting. I don't want to send you to the wrong funds.

00:13:06.777 --> 00:13:09.417
SPEAKER_01: Those are all Vanguard funds?

00:13:11.547 --> 00:13:17.997
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, low fees. VTI has an expense ratio of just point zero three percent. Hard to beat.

00:13:19.777 --> 00:13:22.299
SPEAKER_01: What about actively managed funds?

00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:37.573
SPEAKER_00: Statistically, about... uh... eighty percent of active managers underperform the index over ten years. And they charge more. Or was it ninety percent? I really should... should look that up for you.

00:13:39.073 --> 00:13:41.168
SPEAKER_01: So stick with index funds.

00:13:43.843 --> 00:13:50.293
SPEAKER_00: For core holdings, absolutely. You can always add some active funds later if you want to get fancy.

00:13:52.073 --> 00:13:55.001
SPEAKER_01: What about ESG funds? Environmental stuff?

00:13:56.683 --> 00:14:05.419
SPEAKER_00: If that's important to you, sure. Though they tend to have higher fees and may exclude some profitable sectors.

00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:09.006
SPEAKER_01: Like oil and gas?

00:14:11.689 --> 00:14:18.139
SPEAKER_00: Right. Which have actually done really well lately. Exxon's up thirty percent this year.

00:14:19.919 --> 00:14:22.994
SPEAKER_01: Hmm, something to think about.

00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:31.249
SPEAKER_00: The main thing is having a plan and sticking to it. Market volatility can make people do dumb things.

00:14:32.919 --> 00:14:36.689
SPEAKER_01: Like selling everything in March twenty twenty?

00:14:37.689 --> 00:14:47.140
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. The people who panicked and sold missed out on the recovery. Market's up like seventy percent since then.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.190
SPEAKER_01: I remember being tempted to-- to sell everything.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:15:02.560
SPEAKER_00: Natural reaction. But that's why having a diversified portfolio helps. You're less likely to panic if you're not overly concentrated.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.830
SPEAKER_01: Makes sense. So what's our next step?

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:17.788
SPEAKER_00: I'll put together a formal proposal with the specific allocations and fund recommendations. We can meet next week to review it.

00:15:19.288 --> 00:15:22.124
SPEAKER_01: And start the rebalancing then?

00:15:23.898 --> 00:15:30.618
SPEAKER_00: If you're comfortable with it, yes. I'll also include some projections showing potential returns and risks.

00:15:32.288 --> 00:15:36.058
SPEAKER_01: That would be great. I like seeing the numbers.

00:15:37.058 --> 00:15:43.508
SPEAKER_00: Of course. Oh, and bring your latest 401k statement. We should review your options there too.

00:15:45.288 --> 00:15:48.838
SPEAKER_01: Good point. The fund options are pretty limited.

00:15:49.898 --> 00:15:57.811
SPEAKER_00: They usually are. But we can still optimize within what's available. Target date funds aren't always the best choice.

00:15:58.288 --> 00:16:00.673
SPEAKER_01: I was wondering about those.

00:16:03.058 --> 00:16:11.540
SPEAKER_00: They're convenient but often too conservative as you get closer to the target date. We can build a better allocation manually.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.418
SPEAKER_01: Alright, I'm excited to see what you come up with.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:24.370
SPEAKER_00: Great. And remember, this is a marathon, not a sprint. The key is staying disciplined over the long term.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:33.530
SPEAKER_01: I'll try not to check my balance every day. Though I probably-- probably still will. It's addictive, you know?

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:41.480
SPEAKER_00: Ha, good luck with that. But seriously, maybe check quarterly instead of daily. It'll save your sanity.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:46.810
SPEAKER_01: I'll put it on my calendar.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:54.590
SPEAKER_00: Perfect. And if you have any questions before our next meeting, don't hesitate to call or email.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.030
SPEAKER_01: Will do. Thanks for walking through all this with me.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:07.480
SPEAKER_00: My pleasure. It's always exciting to help someone get their financial house in order.

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.810
SPEAKER_01: I feel much better about everything now.

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:24.994
SPEAKER_00: Good. That's the goal. A solid plan gives you peace of mind to focus on other things in life. Like actually enjoying your money, you know?

00:17:26.494 --> 00:17:29.324
SPEAKER_01: Exactly. Alright, see you next week.

00:17:31.264 --> 00:17:36.551
SPEAKER_00: See you then. Have a great rest of your week.
