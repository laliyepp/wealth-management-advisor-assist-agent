WEBVTT

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.680
SPEAKER_00: Good morning, Jessica. Ready to talk real estate?

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.920
SPEAKER_01: I think so? It's pretty overwhelming honestly. Um...

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:21.340
SPEAKER_00: I get that. Toronto's market is... intense. So you mentioned you're looking at both living in the property and potentially treating it as an investment. Tell me more about that.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:30.020
SPEAKER_01: Well, I'm twenty-nine, making about a hundred and ten thousand. I've been renting downtown for five years.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.240
SPEAKER_00: What are you paying in rent currently?

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.880
SPEAKER_01: Twenty-eight hundred for a one-bedroom near King and Spadina.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:51.300
SPEAKER_00: Ouch. So that's... what... thirty-three, thirty-four thousand a year just in rent. No equity building. What kind of down payment have you saved up?

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.720
SPEAKER_01: About ninety thousand. Been saving aggressively for three years.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:08.140
SPEAKER_00: That's impressive. So with ninety thousand, you're looking at properties around... let me think... four-fifty if you put down twenty percent to avoid CMHC insurance.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.560
SPEAKER_01: But is that realistic in Toronto these days?

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:25.980
SPEAKER_00: For a decent one-bedroom condo downtown? Probably not. I'm seeing listings in the six to eight hundred range for anything decent. Um, what areas are you considering?

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.400
SPEAKER_01: I was looking at King Street West, maybe Liberty Village, or... or further out like North York.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:46.820
SPEAKER_00: Big price differences there. King West you're talking seven-fifty plus for a one-bedroom. North York might be more like five-fifty to six-fifty.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.192
SPEAKER_01: So I'd need to put down less than twenty percent?

00:01:54.692 --> 00:02:12.320
SPEAKER_00: Likely, yeah. With ninety thousand, you could do about fifteen percent down on a six hundred thousand place. But then you're paying CMHC insurance - that's... um... about twenty-four thousand on a six hundred K mortgage.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.440
SPEAKER_01: Twenty-four thousand just for insurance?

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:29.934
SPEAKER_00: It gets rolled into your mortgage, so you pay interest on it too. But it does allow you to buy with less down. The alternative is waiting until you have that full twenty percent.

00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:36.054
SPEAKER_01: How long would that take at my savings rate?

00:02:36.854 --> 00:02:48.474
SPEAKER_00: If prices keep rising... well, that's the catch-twenty-two. By the time you save more, prices might be even higher. What's your monthly savings capacity right now?

00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:55.894
SPEAKER_01: About fifteen hundred a month. Sometimes more if I get bonuses.

00:02:56.694 --> 00:03:09.314
SPEAKER_00: So eighteen thousand a year. To get to twenty percent on a six hundred thousand place, you'd need another thirty thousand. That's almost two more years, assuming prices don't rise.

00:03:10.114 --> 00:03:12.451
SPEAKER_01: And they probably will rise, right?

00:03:14.534 --> 00:03:27.154
SPEAKER_00: Hard to predict, but Toronto's had pretty consistent long-term appreciation. Immigration, population growth, limited supply... though interest rates have cooled things down lately.

00:03:28.954 --> 00:03:32.574
SPEAKER_01: What are mortgage rates looking like now?

00:03:33.374 --> 00:03:46.065
SPEAKER_00: For a five-year fixed, you're looking at around... um... six and a quarter, six and a half percent. Variable rates are a bit lower but riskier.

00:03:47.565 --> 00:03:51.185
SPEAKER_01: That seems high compared to a few years ago.

00:03:51.985 --> 00:04:05.742
SPEAKER_00: It is. We had that crazy period around two percent during COVID. But historically, six percent isn't unreasonable. My parents bought their first place at twelve percent back in the eighties. Can you imagine?

00:04:07.242 --> 00:04:10.862
SPEAKER_01: Yikes. So what would my monthly payments look like?

00:04:11.662 --> 00:04:21.316
SPEAKER_00: On a five hundred thousand mortgage at six and a half percent... let me calculate... probably around three thousand a month. Plus condo fees, property taxes, insurance...

00:04:28.082 --> 00:04:31.702
SPEAKER_01: Condo fees in Toronto are brutal, aren't they?

00:04:32.502 --> 00:04:43.122
SPEAKER_00: They can be. I'm seeing anywhere from four hundred to eight hundred monthly, depending on amenities and building age. Older buildings sometimes have special assessments too.

00:04:44.922 --> 00:04:45.942
SPEAKER_01: Special assessments?

00:04:49.342 --> 00:05:02.618
SPEAKER_00: When the building needs major repairs - roof, elevators, whatever - and the reserve fund isn't enough. Each unit gets hit with their share. Could be ten, twenty thousand or more. I've seen some really nasty surprises.

00:05:04.118 --> 00:05:07.738
SPEAKER_01: That's terrifying. How do you plan for that?

00:05:08.538 --> 00:05:19.158
SPEAKER_00: You can request to see the building's reserve fund study, but honestly it's hard to predict. Newer buildings are generally lower risk, but you pay more upfront.

00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.815
SPEAKER_01: What about property taxes?

00:05:25.378 --> 00:05:36.998
SPEAKER_00: In Toronto, about one and a quarter percent of assessed value annually. So on a six hundred thousand place, maybe seventy-five hundred a year. That's... uh... about six hundred a month.

00:05:38.798 --> 00:05:45.418
SPEAKER_01: So all-in I'm looking at close to four thousand monthly? That's more than my rent.

00:05:46.218 --> 00:05:57.838
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but you're building equity instead of just paying your landlord's mortgage. Plus, you can write off some expenses if you're using it as an investment property.

00:05:59.638 --> 00:06:02.197
SPEAKER_01: How does that work exactly?

00:06:04.058 --> 00:06:17.678
SPEAKER_00: If you rent out a room or use part of it for business, you can deduct a percentage of your costs - mortgage interest, property taxes, condo fees, even depreciation.

00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:24.632
SPEAKER_01: But then I'd have rental income to pay tax on?

00:06:26.132 --> 00:06:36.752
SPEAKER_00: True, but often your expenses offset most of the rental income in the early years. The interest portion of your mortgage payment is fully deductible.

00:06:38.552 --> 00:06:43.172
SPEAKER_01: What if I bought something specifically to rent out?

00:06:43.972 --> 00:06:55.592
SPEAKER_00: That's a different game entirely. You'd need at least twenty percent down, can't use CMHC insurance. But all your costs become deductible against rental income.

00:06:57.392 --> 00:07:00.369
SPEAKER_01: Would that make more financial sense?

00:07:02.812 --> 00:07:18.080
SPEAKER_00: Depends. You're still paying rent somewhere, so you have two housing costs. The rental property needs to cash flow positive or close to it. What kind of rental yields are typical in Toronto? Actually, let me think about that...

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.200
SPEAKER_01: I have no idea. Three percent? Four?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:36.620
SPEAKER_00: More like two to three percent gross. So a six hundred thousand condo might rent for... what... three thousand a month? That's thirty-six thousand annually, so six percent gross yield.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.040
SPEAKER_01: But my costs would be more than that.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:55.460
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Mortgage payments alone would be thirty-six thousand annually. Plus property taxes, condo fees, insurance, maintenance... you'd be cash flow negative for years.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.578
SPEAKER_01: So it only works with appreciation?

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:11.318
SPEAKER_00: Pretty much. You're betting that the property appreciates faster than your annual losses. Toronto's done well historically, but... no guarantees, right?

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.671
SPEAKER_01: What kind of appreciation rates?

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:32.140
SPEAKER_00: Over the long term, maybe four to six percent annually. Though we had that crazy run from twenty-fifteen to twenty-twenty where prices doubled in some areas.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.049
SPEAKER_01: And recently?

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:49.980
SPEAKER_00: Prices have pulled back maybe ten to fifteen percent from the peaks. Interest rates really cooled demand. But they seem to be stabilizing now.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.583
SPEAKER_01: So maybe a good time to buy?

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:07.820
SPEAKER_00: Could be. Though trying to time real estate markets is... it's tricky. If you're buying to live in long-term, timing matters less than finding the right property.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.318
SPEAKER_01: What about different property types? Condos versus houses?

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:27.660
SPEAKER_00: Houses give you more control - no condo fees, no board decisions. But in Toronto, even townhouses start around eight hundred thousand. Detached homes, forget about it.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.035
SPEAKER_01: What do houses typically rent for?

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:45.500
SPEAKER_00: Depends on size and location. A three-bedroom house might rent for four to six thousand monthly. Better cash flow potential, but much higher entry cost.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.879
SPEAKER_01: And I definitely don't have that kind of down payment.

00:09:54.379 --> 00:10:05.999
SPEAKER_00: Not yet. Though house prices have come down more than condos. I've seen some listings drop fifty to a hundred thousand from their peaks.

00:10:07.799 --> 00:10:11.419
SPEAKER_01: Still way out of my range though.

00:10:12.219 --> 00:10:23.839
SPEAKER_00: For now. But real estate's a long game. You could start with a condo, build equity, then trade up to a house in five to ten years.

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:28.139
SPEAKER_01: Is that a typical strategy?

00:10:31.059 --> 00:10:42.679
SPEAKER_00: Very common. Use your first property as a stepping stone. Some people keep the condo as a rental when they upgrade, if they can qualify for two mortgages.

00:10:44.479 --> 00:10:49.099
SPEAKER_01: How hard is it to qualify for multiple mortgages?

00:10:49.899 --> 00:11:02.519
SPEAKER_00: The lenders look at your total debt service ratios. Generally want your housing costs under thirty-two percent of gross income, total debt under forty percent.

00:11:04.319 --> 00:11:06.894
SPEAKER_01: And they count rental income?

00:11:09.739 --> 00:11:20.359
SPEAKER_00: Usually only fifty to seventy-five percent of it, to account for vacancies and expenses. So it helps, but not dollar-for-dollar.

00:11:22.159 --> 00:11:25.779
SPEAKER_01: What about closing costs on the purchase?

00:11:26.579 --> 00:11:39.199
SPEAKER_00: Good question. Land transfer tax in Toronto is brutal - you pay both provincial and municipal. On a six hundred thousand place, that's about... let me calculate... seventeen thousand just in land transfer tax.

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:43.418
SPEAKER_01: Seventeen thousand? Just in tax?

00:11:45.419 --> 00:11:58.039
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Toronto has the highest land transfer taxes in Canada. Plus legal fees, home inspection, title insurance... budget another five to eight thousand for miscellaneous costs.

00:11:59.839 --> 00:12:03.459
SPEAKER_01: So twenty-five thousand in closing costs?

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:15.879
SPEAKER_00: About that. Though first-time buyers get a rebate on the provincial land transfer tax - up to four thousand. Are you a first-time buyer?

00:12:17.679 --> 00:12:19.995
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, never owned before.

00:12:21.099 --> 00:12:32.719
SPEAKER_00: Good, that helps a bit. There's also the Home Buyers' Plan - you can borrow up to thirty-five thousand from your RRSP for a down payment.

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:37.952
SPEAKER_01: But I'd have to pay that back?

00:12:39.939 --> 00:12:50.424
SPEAKER_00: Over fifteen years, yes. About twenty-three hundred annually. But it's interest-free, and you're borrowing from yourself.

00:12:53.359 --> 00:12:57.979
SPEAKER_01: I only have about twenty thousand in my RRSP though.

00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:09.399
SPEAKER_00: So you could use that. Combined with your ninety thousand in savings, you'd have a hundred and ten for down payment and closing costs.

00:13:11.199 --> 00:13:15.819
SPEAKER_01: That would work for something around six hundred thousand.

00:13:16.619 --> 00:13:25.916
SPEAKER_00: Right. Fifteen percent down, plus closing costs. You'd need about a five hundred thousand mortgage. Are you pre-approved yet?

00:13:30.039 --> 00:13:31.873
SPEAKER_01: No, should I be?

00:13:34.459 --> 00:13:49.700
SPEAKER_00: Definitely. It shows sellers you're serious, and you'll know exactly what you can afford. Mortgage brokers can often get better rates than going directly to banks. Though I should mention, I'm, uh, not certain about current broker rates...

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.693
SPEAKER_01: Any other costs I'm missing?

00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:06.100
SPEAKER_00: Property insurance - maybe hundred and fifty a month. Utilities if they're not included. And you'll want an emergency fund for unexpected repairs.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.467
SPEAKER_01: How much emergency fund?

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:22.736
SPEAKER_00: For a condo, maybe ten thousand? Houses need more because you're responsible for everything - roof, furnace, plumbing.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.500
SPEAKER_01: This is starting to feel really expensive. Like, really expensive.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:44.920
SPEAKER_00: It is a big financial commitment. But remember, you're already paying twenty-eight hundred in rent. Some of that mortgage payment is building equity.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.356
SPEAKER_01: How much equity in the first few years?

00:14:52.140 --> 00:15:03.760
SPEAKER_00: Not much honestly. Most of your payment goes to interest initially. On a five hundred thousand mortgage, maybe eight to ten thousand goes to principal in the first year.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.374
SPEAKER_01: Plus appreciation hopefully.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:21.600
SPEAKER_00: Right. If the property appreciates four percent annually, that's twenty-four thousand on a six hundred thousand place. Much more meaningful than the principal paydown.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.721
SPEAKER_01: But appreciation isn't guaranteed.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:39.440
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely not. Real estate can be cyclical. We might see flat prices for years, or even declines. That's why location and long-term thinking matter.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.693
SPEAKER_01: What makes a good location?

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:55.991
SPEAKER_00: Transit access is huge in Toronto. Subway lines, GO trains. Walkability, good schools if you plan to have kids, proximity to employment centers.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.700
SPEAKER_01: So downtown is still better than suburbs?

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:16.120
SPEAKER_00: For long-term appreciation, probably. But you pay a premium for it. Sometimes suburban properties offer better cash flow if you're renting out.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.057
SPEAKER_01: What about new construction versus resale?

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:34.960
SPEAKER_00: New construction means no immediate repairs, modern layouts, energy efficiency. But you pay a premium, and there's construction risk - delays, builder issues.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.952
SPEAKER_01: Construction risk?

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:52.800
SPEAKER_00: Projects can get delayed years. Builders sometimes go bankrupt. Plus you don't know what the building culture will be like until people actually move in.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.787
SPEAKER_01: So maybe stick with existing buildings?

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:12.640
SPEAKER_00: For your first purchase, probably safer. You can see exactly what you're getting, check the building's financial statements, talk to current residents.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.060
SPEAKER_01: How do I evaluate a building's finances?

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:29.632
SPEAKER_00: Look at the reserve fund balance, recent special assessments, planned major repairs. A good building should have strong reserves and proactive maintenance.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.900
SPEAKER_01: This is a lot to think about.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:49.320
SPEAKER_00: It is. Real estate's probably the biggest financial decision most people make. Take your time, do your research, don't let emotions drive the decision.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.465
SPEAKER_01: Should I start looking seriously now?

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:07.160
SPEAKER_00: Get that pre-approval first. Then you can shop with confidence. Market's been pretty stable lately, so there's no huge rush, but good properties still move quickly.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.602
SPEAKER_01: Any final advice?

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:26.000
SPEAKER_00: Buy the worst unit in the best building you can afford, rather than the best unit in a marginal building. And remember, you can always renovate or upgrade later.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.420
SPEAKER_01: That's helpful. Thanks for walking through all this.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:44.769
SPEAKER_00: My pleasure. Real estate in Toronto is complex, but it's still been one of the best long-term wealth builders for most people. Just go in with your eyes open.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.206
SPEAKER_01: I definitely feel more informed now.

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:57.174
SPEAKER_00: Good luck with the search. And call me when you find something you're serious about.
