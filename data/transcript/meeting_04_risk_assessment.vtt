00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:10.630
SPEAKER_00: Hi Jennifer, thanks for coming in. I understand you want to reassess your risk tolerance after the recent market volatility?

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:19.603
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I've been losing sleep watching my portfolio swing up and down twenty thousand in a day.

00:00:21.103 --> 00:00:28.615
SPEAKER_00: That's completely understandable. The VIX has been above thirty for months now. What's your current allocation?

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:37.034
SPEAKER_01: Eighty percent stocks, twenty percent bonds. I'm forty-two, so I thought that was appropriate.

00:00:38.534 --> 00:00:50.104
SPEAKER_00: The traditional rule of thumb would suggest that, yes. But... well, rules of thumb don't really account for your personal psychology.

00:00:51.604 --> 00:00:53.431
SPEAKER_01: What do you mean?

00:00:56.404 --> 00:01:05.692
SPEAKER_00: Well, if market swings are keeping you awake at night, you might be taking more risk than you can emotionally handle.

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:13.120
SPEAKER_01: But won't I miss out on returns if I get too conservative?

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:28.338
SPEAKER_00: Maybe, but what good are theoretical returns if you panic and sell at the bottom? I mean, that happened to a lot of people in March 2020.

00:01:29.838 --> 00:01:33.588
SPEAKER_01: I came close to selling everything then.

00:01:34.638 --> 00:01:44.876
SPEAKER_00: See? And if you had, you'd have missed the sixty percent rebound. It's better to have an allocation you can actually stick with.

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:50.126
SPEAKER_01: So how do we figure out what that is?

00:01:51.176 --> 00:01:59.253
SPEAKER_00: Let's start with the numbers. What's your total portfolio value, and how much can you afford to lose without panicking?

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:04.503
SPEAKER_01: It's at about four hundred thousand right now. Um...

00:02:05.553 --> 00:02:13.865
SPEAKER_00: Take your time. Think about dollar amounts, not percentages. If you woke up and your account was down fifty thousand...

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:19.115
SPEAKER_01: Fifty thousand? I'd probably throw up.

00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:26.315
SPEAKER_00: Okay, what about twenty-five thousand? That's about, uh, six percent of your portfolio.

00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:32.835
SPEAKER_01: That would be nerve-wracking, but I could probably handle it.

00:02:34.335 --> 00:02:43.641
SPEAKER_00: Good. So if we can design a portfolio that rarely drops more than six percent in a month, you'd sleep better?

00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:47.136
SPEAKER_01: Definitely. Is that realistic?

00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:56.091
SPEAKER_00: With your current allocation? Probably not. The S&P dropped twelve percent in September '22 alone.

00:02:57.141 --> 00:03:00.891
SPEAKER_01: Right, and I had sleepless nights that whole month.

00:03:01.941 --> 00:03:08.091
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. But if we reduced your stock allocation to say, sixty percent, the swings would be smaller.

00:03:09.141 --> 00:03:10.963
SPEAKER_01: How much smaller?

00:03:13.941 --> 00:03:20.091
SPEAKER_00: Historically, a sixty-forty portfolio has about twenty percent less volatility than an eighty-twenty.

00:03:21.141 --> 00:03:23.204
SPEAKER_01: But also lower returns?

00:03:25.941 --> 00:03:32.091
SPEAKER_00: Over the long term, yes. Maybe eight percent annual returns versus... well, nine-point-five percent.

00:03:33.141 --> 00:03:36.891
SPEAKER_01: That's a meaningful difference over twenty years.

00:03:37.941 --> 00:03:45.920
SPEAKER_00: It is. But remember, that assumes you stay invested. If volatility causes you to sell and buy at the wrong times...

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.170
SPEAKER_01: I could end up with even lower returns.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:59.793
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Studies show the average investor underperforms the market by two to three percent annually due to poor timing.

00:04:01.293 --> 00:04:05.043
SPEAKER_01: So staying invested is more important than the perfect allocation?

00:04:06.093 --> 00:04:12.243
SPEAKER_00: Bingo. A good portfolio you can stick with beats a perfect portfolio you abandon.

00:04:13.293 --> 00:04:17.043
SPEAKER_01: That makes sense. What about the bond portion?

00:04:18.093 --> 00:04:28.890
SPEAKER_00: Good question. Bond funds have been brutal this year with interest rates rising. The aggregate bond index is down, what, ten percent?

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.140
SPEAKER_01: I thought bonds were supposed to be safe!

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.340
SPEAKER_00: They are if you hold individual bonds to maturity. But bond funds have interest rate risk.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.660
SPEAKER_01: So should I avoid bond funds?

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.340
SPEAKER_00: Not necessarily. They provide diversification and income. But maybe shorter duration funds would be less volatile.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.982
SPEAKER_01: What's duration mean again?

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.340
SPEAKER_00: Roughly how sensitive a bond is to interest rate changes. Longer duration equals more price volatility.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.140
SPEAKER_01: So short-term bond funds are less risky?

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:17.340
SPEAKER_00: From a price volatility standpoint, yes. Though they typically yield less than longer-term bonds.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.007
SPEAKER_01: Everything's a trade-off.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:29.340
SPEAKER_00: Welcome to investing. Risk and return are joined at the hip. There are no free lunches.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.140
SPEAKER_01: What about alternatives? Like gold or commodities?

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.965
SPEAKER_00: They can provide diversification, but they're often more volatile than stocks. Gold dropped thirty percent in 2013.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.920
SPEAKER_01: That doesn't sound very safe.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.340
SPEAKER_00: It's not. Gold might hedge against inflation, but it's not a volatility reducer.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.985
SPEAKER_01: What about real estate?

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:07.644
SPEAKER_00: REITs can be good diversifiers, but they're correlated with stocks more than people think. Especially during crises.

00:06:09.144 --> 00:06:12.894
SPEAKER_01: They dropped with everything else in March twenty twenty?

00:06:13.944 --> 00:06:20.094
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Down thirty percent in a month. Correlations go to one when you need diversification most.

00:06:21.144 --> 00:06:23.605
SPEAKER_01: So what actually provides true diversification?

00:06:25.944 --> 00:06:32.094
SPEAKER_00: Honestly? High-quality bonds, despite their recent performance. And maybe some international exposure.

00:06:33.144 --> 00:06:36.894
SPEAKER_01: International stocks have been dogs for years.

00:06:37.944 --> 00:06:44.888
SPEAKER_00: They have, but that might be opportunity. European and emerging market valuations are much cheaper than the US.

00:06:45.144 --> 00:06:46.999
SPEAKER_01: How much cheaper?

00:06:49.944 --> 00:06:57.496
SPEAKER_00: Europe's trading at about thirteen times earnings versus twenty-four for the S&P. Emerging markets at twelve times.

00:06:58.996 --> 00:07:01.776
SPEAKER_01: So they're on sale?

00:07:03.796 --> 00:07:09.946
SPEAKER_00: Potentially. Value stocks have historically outperformed over long periods, but it can take years to play out.

00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:14.746
SPEAKER_01: And I need to be able to stomach the volatility.

00:07:15.796 --> 00:07:21.946
SPEAKER_00: Right. International stocks can be even more volatile than US stocks, especially emerging markets.

00:07:22.996 --> 00:07:25.185
SPEAKER_01: Maybe a small allocation then?

00:07:27.796 --> 00:07:33.946
SPEAKER_00: That's sensible. Maybe ten to fifteen percent of your stock allocation. Test the waters.

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.785
SPEAKER_01: What about sector concentration?

00:07:39.796 --> 00:07:49.253
SPEAKER_00: Good point. Tech is thirty percent of the S&P 500 now. That's a lot of concentration risk.

00:07:50.753 --> 00:07:53.385
SPEAKER_01: Should I avoid tech stocks?

00:07:55.553 --> 00:08:01.703
SPEAKER_00: Not avoid, but maybe not overweight them. Total stock market funds give you natural diversification.

00:08:02.753 --> 00:08:04.722
SPEAKER_01: What about individual stocks?

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:13.703
SPEAKER_00: For someone concerned about volatility, I'd stick with diversified funds. Individual stocks are much riskier.

00:08:14.753 --> 00:08:16.726
SPEAKER_01: Even blue chips?

00:08:19.553 --> 00:08:25.703
SPEAKER_00: Remember Enron? WorldCom? They were blue chips until they weren't. Company-specific risk is real.

00:08:26.753 --> 00:08:27.751
SPEAKER_01: Point taken.

00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:37.703
SPEAKER_00: Now, let's talk about your time horizon. When do you need this money?

00:08:38.753 --> 00:08:41.678
SPEAKER_01: Retirement, so about twenty-three years.

00:08:43.553 --> 00:08:53.454
SPEAKER_00: That's a long time horizon. You can ride out several market cycles. But if you're losing sleep now...

00:08:54.954 --> 00:08:57.528
SPEAKER_01: The stress isn't worth it.

00:08:59.754 --> 00:09:05.904
SPEAKER_00: Agreed. What good is wealth if the process of building it makes you miserable?

00:09:06.954 --> 00:09:10.704
SPEAKER_01: So you're okay with me being more conservative?

00:09:11.754 --> 00:09:17.904
SPEAKER_00: If it means you stay invested and don't make emotional decisions, absolutely.

00:09:18.954 --> 00:09:22.133
SPEAKER_01: What allocation would you suggest?

00:09:23.754 --> 00:09:29.904
SPEAKER_00: Maybe sixty-five percent stocks, thirty-five percent bonds? Still growth-oriented but, uh, more stable.

00:09:30.954 --> 00:09:33.353
SPEAKER_01: And within the stock portion?

00:09:35.754 --> 00:09:41.904
SPEAKER_00: Maybe eighty percent US total market, fifteen percent international developed, five percent emerging markets.

00:09:42.954 --> 00:09:44.522
SPEAKER_01: That sounds reasonable.

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:53.904
SPEAKER_00: For bonds, maybe seventy percent intermediate-term, thirty percent short-term for stability.

00:09:54.954 --> 00:09:58.704
SPEAKER_01: How do we transition to this allocation?

00:09:59.754 --> 00:10:07.676
SPEAKER_00: Gradually. Maybe sell five percent of your stock funds each month and buy bonds. Dollar-cost averaging in reverse.

00:10:09.176 --> 00:10:12.926
SPEAKER_01: So I don't try to time the market?

00:10:13.976 --> 00:10:20.126
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. You'll sell some at high prices, some at low prices. It averages out.

00:10:21.176 --> 00:10:24.926
SPEAKER_01: That takes the emotion out of it.

00:10:25.976 --> 00:10:32.126
SPEAKER_00: Which is the goal. Successful investing is mostly about controlling your emotions.

00:10:33.176 --> 00:10:35.183
SPEAKER_01: What about rebalancing going forward?

00:10:37.976 --> 00:10:48.492
SPEAKER_00: I'd suggest quarterly. More frequent than that and you might over-trade. Less frequent and you drift too far from target.

00:10:49.992 --> 00:10:53.742
SPEAKER_01: Should I rebalance by calendar or by thresholds?

00:10:54.792 --> 00:11:02.691
SPEAKER_00: Good question. I prefer threshold-based. If any asset class moves more than five percentage points from target, rebalance.

00:11:04.191 --> 00:11:07.941
SPEAKER_01: So it's market-driven rather than time-driven?

00:11:08.991 --> 00:11:15.141
SPEAKER_00: Right. You naturally sell high and buy low. It's a form of contrarian investing.

00:11:16.191 --> 00:11:18.550
SPEAKER_01: I like that philosophy.

00:11:20.991 --> 00:11:27.141
SPEAKER_00: It works, but it feels uncomfortable. You'll be buying bonds when everyone says they're dead.

00:11:28.191 --> 00:11:31.941
SPEAKER_01: And selling stocks when everyone's optimistic?

00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:39.141
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Warren Buffett says be greedy when others are fearful, fearful when others are greedy.

00:11:40.191 --> 00:11:42.001
SPEAKER_01: Easier said than done.

00:11:44.991 --> 00:11:51.141
SPEAKER_00: True. That's why having a systematic approach helps. Takes some of the emotion out of it.

00:11:52.191 --> 00:11:54.531
SPEAKER_01: What about during major market crashes?

00:11:56.991 --> 00:12:03.141
SPEAKER_00: Those are the hardest times, but also the most important to stick to your plan.

00:12:04.191 --> 00:12:07.941
SPEAKER_01: Even if everyone's predicting the end of the world?

00:12:08.991 --> 00:12:15.141
SPEAKER_00: Especially then. Markets recover eventually. They always have. Though it can take years.

00:12:16.191 --> 00:12:19.125
SPEAKER_01: How long was the longest recovery?

00:12:20.991 --> 00:12:30.139
SPEAKER_00: Depends how you measure it. From the 2000 peak, it took thirteen years to break even in real terms.

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:35.389
SPEAKER_01: Thirteen years? That's a long time.

00:12:36.439 --> 00:12:42.589
SPEAKER_00: It is. But remember, you'd have been collecting dividends that whole time. Plus making new contributions.

00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:46.131
SPEAKER_01: Dollar-cost averaging during the decline?

00:12:48.439 --> 00:12:54.589
SPEAKER_00: Right. People who kept investing during the lost decade actually did quite well.

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:59.389
SPEAKER_01: Because they were buying at low prices?

00:13:00.439 --> 00:13:03.981
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Same concept as rebalancing. Mechanical investing beats emotional investing.

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:11.389
SPEAKER_01: I'm starting to see the pattern.

00:13:12.439 --> 00:13:18.589
SPEAKER_00: Good. The key is finding an approach you can stick with through good times and bad.

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:22.211
SPEAKER_01: This conversation has been really helpful.

00:13:24.439 --> 00:13:30.589
SPEAKER_00: I'm glad. Sometimes people think being conservative means you're not serious about building wealth.

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:35.389
SPEAKER_01: But if it keeps me invested, it's actually better?

00:13:36.439 --> 00:13:42.589
SPEAKER_00: Potentially, yes. Consistent mediocre returns beat erratic great returns you can't stick with.

00:13:43.639 --> 00:13:46.237
SPEAKER_01: That's counterintuitive but makes sense.

00:13:48.439 --> 00:13:54.589
SPEAKER_00: Most of successful investing is counterintuitive. The obvious moves are usually wrong.

00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:58.724
SPEAKER_01: Like buying when everyone's selling?

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:06.589
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Or maintaining your allocation when everything seems to be going to hell.

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:11.389
SPEAKER_01: I'll try to remember that during the next crash.

00:14:12.439 --> 00:14:18.589
SPEAKER_00: Write it down. Put a note in your investment account. "Stay the course - historical perspective matters."

00:14:19.639 --> 00:14:23.389
SPEAKER_01: Good idea. Should we start the rebalancing next week?

00:14:24.439 --> 00:14:32.027
SPEAKER_00: If you're comfortable with the plan, sure. Remember, it might take three or four months to complete.

00:14:33.527 --> 00:14:37.277
SPEAKER_01: And my returns might lag in a bull market?

00:14:38.327 --> 00:14:44.477
SPEAKER_00: Possibly. But you'll also lose less in bear markets. It's about total risk-adjusted returns.

00:14:45.527 --> 00:14:48.335
SPEAKER_01: And sleeping better at night.

00:14:50.327 --> 00:14:56.477
SPEAKER_00: Don't underestimate that. Peace of mind has value that doesn't show up in performance charts.

00:14:57.527 --> 00:14:59.522
SPEAKER_01: You're absolutely right.

00:15:02.327 --> 00:15:12.318
SPEAKER_00: Alright, let's schedule a follow-up in a few months to see how you're feeling with the new allocation.

00:15:13.818 --> 00:15:17.568
SPEAKER_01: Perfect. Thank you for talking me through all this.

00:15:18.618 --> 00:15:24.768
SPEAKER_00: You're welcome. Remember, the best investment strategy is one you can actually execute.

00:15:25.818 --> 00:15:29.568
SPEAKER_01: I'll keep that in mind. Thanks again.

00:15:30.618 --> 00:15:34.768
SPEAKER_00: Anytime. Here's to better sleep and steady returns.
