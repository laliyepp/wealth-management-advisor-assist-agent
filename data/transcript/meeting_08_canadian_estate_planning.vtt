00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.266
SPEAKER_00: Good afternoon, Robert. Thanks for coming in to discuss estate planning.

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:13.591
SPEAKER_01: Well, I figured it was time. I'm fifty-five now, kids are-- kids are grown up.

00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:28.167
SPEAKER_00: Smart timing. A lot of people put this off until it's too late. So, um, tell me about your current situation - family, assets, that sort of thing.

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:37.997
SPEAKER_01: Married to Linda for twenty-eight years. Two kids - David's twenty-six, Sarah's twenty-four. Both doing well, thankfully.

00:00:39.297 --> 00:00:47.737
SPEAKER_00: Good. And asset-wise? I know from our previous meetings you've built up a decent portfolio, but let's go through the details.

00:00:48.787 --> 00:00:58.497
SPEAKER_01: Well, the house is worth about nine hundred thousand now. No mortgage left. RRSPs total around four hundred thousand.

00:00:59.297 --> 00:01:02.671
SPEAKER_00: That's between you and Linda combined?

00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:08.339
SPEAKER_01: No, that's just mine. Linda has about two hundred thousand in hers.

00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:12.995
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so six hundred total in RRSPs. What about TFSAs?

00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:23.179
SPEAKER_01: We've both maxed those out. About ninety thousand each, so one-eighty total.

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:26.120
SPEAKER_00: Non-registered investments?

00:01:32.278 --> 00:01:38.588
SPEAKER_01: Maybe three hundred thousand in my taxable account. Mix of stocks and bonds.

00:01:39.388 --> 00:01:45.935
SPEAKER_00: So we're looking at roughly... what... one point four million in total assets?

00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:52.638
SPEAKER_01: Sounds about right. Plus I've got a small pension from my previous employer.

00:01:53.138 --> 00:01:57.877
SPEAKER_00: What's that worth? And are you still working now?

00:02:01.052 --> 00:02:09.914
SPEAKER_01: The pension's maybe fifty thousand in present value. And yeah, I'm still working. Making about a hundred and thirty thousand.

00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:22.727
SPEAKER_00: Excellent. So you're in a good position. Now, estate planning in Canada has some... some unique considerations. The biggest one is the deemed disposition rule.

00:02:25.754 --> 00:02:27.327
SPEAKER_01: Deemed disposition?

00:02:29.754 --> 00:02:45.546
SPEAKER_00: When you die, Canada treats it as if you sold all your assets at fair market value. So any capital gains get triggered immediately. Could create a significant tax bill for your estate.

00:02:47.046 --> 00:02:50.806
SPEAKER_01: Even if I don't actually sell anything?

00:02:51.606 --> 00:03:03.026
SPEAKER_00: Right. It's a fiction, but the tax is real. On your non-registered investments, any appreciation since you bought them becomes taxable.

00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:08.778
SPEAKER_01: What kind of tax bill are we talking about?

00:03:09.716 --> 00:03:24.610
SPEAKER_00: Hard to say without knowing your cost basis, but... let's say you have a hundred thousand in capital gains. That's fifty thousand in taxable capital gains at your marginal rate. Maybe twenty-five thousand in tax?

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.326
SPEAKER_01: That's a lot of money.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:40.889
SPEAKER_00: It can be. And that's just the non-registered stuff. RRSPs are even worse - the full balance becomes taxable income in your final year.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.253
SPEAKER_01: The full four hundred thousand?

00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:59.581
SPEAKER_00: If it goes to your kids directly, yes. That would push your final tax return into the highest bracket. We're talking close to two hundred thousand in taxes.

00:04:00.381 --> 00:04:04.259
SPEAKER_01: Jesus. Half the RRSP gone to taxes?

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:18.879
SPEAKER_00: At current rates, yeah. Though there are ways too minimize this. If Linda inherits your RRSP, she can roll it into her own tax-free. That defers the tax bill.

00:04:19.679 --> 00:04:24.509
SPEAKER_01: But then Linda faces the same problem when she dies?

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:37.224
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. So we need strategies to get money out of RRSPs gradually while you're both alive. What are you planning for retirement age?

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:44.849
SPEAKER_01: Maybe sixty-two? I could afford to retire then.

00:04:45.649 --> 00:05:00.483
SPEAKER_00: Good. That gives us seven years to start drawing down RRSPs strategically. Even if you don't need the money, you might want too convert some to TFSAs or non-registered accounts.

00:05:01.983 --> 00:05:03.984
SPEAKER_01: Convert RRSPs to TFSAs?

00:05:06.513 --> 00:05:20.293
SPEAKER_00: Well, you'd withdraw from the RRSP, pay tax on it, then contribute the after-tax amount to your TFSA if you have room. Future growth would then be tax-free.

00:05:22.093 --> 00:05:25.183
SPEAKER_01: Do we have TFSA room left?

00:05:25.983 --> 00:05:39.017
SPEAKER_00: You're both maxed now, but you get new room each year. In twenty twenty-four it's... um... seven thousand each. So fourteen thousand annually you could shelter from future taxes.

00:05:40.517 --> 00:05:44.632
SPEAKER_01: That seems small compared to the RRSP balances.

00:05:46.132 --> 00:05:54.108
SPEAKER_00: It is, but every bit helps. And there are other strategies. What about life insurance?

00:05:56.962 --> 00:06:00.703
SPEAKER_01: I have some group coverage through work.

00:06:02.203 --> 00:06:06.413
SPEAKER_00: How much? And does it continue into retirement?

00:06:11.853 --> 00:06:16.523
SPEAKER_01: Two hundred thousand, and no, it ends when I retire.

00:06:18.023 --> 00:06:30.711
SPEAKER_00: So there's a potential gap. Life insurance can be a good estate planning tool because the death benefit is generally tax-free to beneficiaries.

00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:36.758
SPEAKER_01: But I'd have to pay premiums for years.

00:06:38.258 --> 00:06:49.368
SPEAKER_00: True. It's really about liquidity. If your estate faces a big tax bill, insurance provides cash to pay it without having to sell other assets.

00:06:51.148 --> 00:06:54.382
SPEAKER_01: What would that cost at my age?

00:06:57.368 --> 00:07:09.157
SPEAKER_00: Depends on your health and the amount. Term insurance might be fifteen hundred annually for too hundred thousand coverage. Permanent insurance would be much more.

00:07:12.258 --> 00:07:14.916
SPEAKER_01: Term insurance ends eventually though, right?

00:07:17.918 --> 00:07:27.884
SPEAKER_00: Usually at age seventy or eighty. The idea is that by then you've hopefully reduced your estate tax exposure through other strategies.

00:07:32.538 --> 00:07:34.243
SPEAKER_01: What other strategies?

00:07:37.758 --> 00:07:48.682
SPEAKER_00: Well, gifting during your lifetime is one. If you give assets to your kids now, the capital gains get triggered, but you can plan the timing to minimize tax.

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:58.892
SPEAKER_01: So I'd pay tax on the gains now instead of later?

00:08:00.392 --> 00:08:10.502
SPEAKER_00: Right. And if you're in a lower tax bracket now than your estate would be, that could save money overall.

00:08:12.282 --> 00:08:15.440
SPEAKER_01: Are there limits on gifting to family?

00:08:18.052 --> 00:08:26.832
SPEAKER_00: Not like in the US. Canada doesn't have gift taxes, but you still trigger capital gains when you transfer appreciated assets.

00:08:28.502 --> 00:08:31.405
SPEAKER_01: What about the principal residence exemption?

00:08:34.832 --> 00:08:42.173
SPEAKER_00: Your house should qualify. Only one principal residence per family, but the full gain is usually tax-free.

00:08:46.282 --> 00:08:49.182
SPEAKER_01: Even nine hundred thousand worth?

00:08:53.052 --> 00:09:07.058
SPEAKER_00: As long as it's been your principal residence the whole time you owned it. Though there are some rules about... let me think... about designating which property if you own multiple.

00:09:08.558 --> 00:09:11.836
SPEAKER_01: We just have the one house.

00:09:14.168 --> 00:09:19.531
SPEAKER_00: Then you should be fine. That's nine hundred thousand that transfers tax-free.

00:09:23.558 --> 00:09:27.908
SPEAKER_01: What about trusts? I hear people talk about those.

00:09:29.328 --> 00:09:39.778
SPEAKER_00: Trusts can be useful, but they're complex in Canada. We have attribution rules that can push income back to the person who funded the trust.

00:09:41.558 --> 00:09:44.154
SPEAKER_01: So they don't save taxes?

00:09:47.168 --> 00:09:58.888
SPEAKER_00: Not always. They're more about control and protection. Like if you're worried about a child going through a divorce or having creditor issues.

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:03.388
SPEAKER_01: My kids seem pretty stable, thankfully.

00:10:06.328 --> 00:10:13.778
SPEAKER_00: That's good. Though you never know what the future holds. What are their financial situations like?

00:10:15.558 --> 00:10:24.061
SPEAKER_01: David's an engineer, making good money. Sarah's a teacher, loves it but-- but not getting rich.

00:10:24.168 --> 00:10:29.178
SPEAKER_00: So maybe different needs when it comes to inheritance timing?

00:10:33.058 --> 00:10:37.828
SPEAKER_01: Possibly. Sarah could probably use help with a house down payment.

00:10:38.828 --> 00:10:50.521
SPEAKER_00: That's where gifting during your lifetime makes sense. You can see the money being put too good use, and it starts reducing your estate tax exposure.

00:10:52.021 --> 00:10:56.554
SPEAKER_01: How much can I give without triggering big tax bills?

00:10:56.631 --> 00:11:09.192
SPEAKER_00: If it's cash from your savings, no immediate tax. If it's appreciated investments, you'd pay capital gains. But you could do it gradually over several years.

00:11:10.692 --> 00:11:14.462
SPEAKER_01: What about RESPs? The kids are past that age.

00:11:15.462 --> 00:11:26.912
SPEAKER_00: RESPs are great for grandchildren if that's ever relevant. The government grants make them very attractive while the kids are young.

00:11:28.692 --> 00:11:31.225
SPEAKER_01: No grandkids yet, but maybe someday.

00:11:33.802 --> 00:11:41.011
SPEAKER_00: Something to keep in mind. Now, let's talk about the mechanics. Do you have an up-to-date will?

00:11:47.419 --> 00:11:50.452
SPEAKER_01: We did wills about ten years ago.

00:11:53.689 --> 00:12:00.650
SPEAKER_00: Probably worth updating. Asset values have changed, maybe your wishes have too. What about powers of attorney?

00:12:04.504 --> 00:12:07.485
SPEAKER_01: I think those are in the wills?

00:12:09.614 --> 00:12:21.015
SPEAKER_00: Maybe, but they're usually separate documents. You want both financial and personal care powers of attorney in case you become incapacitated.

00:12:22.504 --> 00:12:25.432
SPEAKER_01: Linda would handle that stuff.

00:12:28.774 --> 00:12:36.784
SPEAKER_00: Right, but you want it documented properly. And what if you're both incapacitated? Maybe your kids as backup attorneys?

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.437
SPEAKER_01: That makes sense. What about executor duties?

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:59.930
SPEAKER_00: Being an executor in Canada is... it's a big job. Dealing with CRA, filing final tax returns, distributing assets. Takes months or years.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.793
SPEAKER_01: Should I name both kids as co-executors?

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:19.238
SPEAKER_00: That can work, but sometimes creates conflict. One primary executor with the other as backup might be cleaner. Or even a professional trustee for complex estates.

00:13:20.738 --> 00:13:22.422
SPEAKER_01: How complex is complex?

00:13:27.535 --> 00:13:33.376
SPEAKER_00: Multiple properties, business interests, complicated family situations. Your estate is substantial but pretty straightforward.

00:13:40.425 --> 00:13:42.142
SPEAKER_01: What about charitable giving?

00:13:47.195 --> 00:13:57.645
SPEAKER_00: Great question. Charitable donations in your will get very generous tax credits - can often eliminate much of the final tax bill.

00:13:59.425 --> 00:14:00.531
SPEAKER_01: How generous?

00:14:04.535 --> 00:14:23.084
SPEAKER_00: You can claim up to one hundred percent of net income in the year of death, plus one hundred percent of the prior year. Credits are... um... roughly fifty percent at high income levels. Actually, let me double-check that calculation for you.

00:14:24.584 --> 00:14:29.224
SPEAKER_01: So donate a hundred thousand, save fifty thousand in taxes?

00:14:31.354 --> 00:14:42.804
SPEAKER_00: Roughly, yeah. It's actually more nuanced - the first two hundred dollars is fifteen percent federal credit, then twenty-nine percent, then there's provincial...

00:14:44.584 --> 00:14:46.555
SPEAKER_01: Okay, but significant savings.

00:14:49.694 --> 00:15:00.380
SPEAKER_00: Definitely. And if you're charitably inclined anyway, it's much more tax-efficient to give through your estate than during your lifetime.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.276
SPEAKER_01: Why's that?

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:18.100
SPEAKER_00: During your lifetime, you're limited to seventy-five percent of net income for donations. At death, it's one hundred percent plus the carryback.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.365
SPEAKER_01: Any charities you'd recommend?

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:33.427
SPEAKER_00: That's really personal. What causes matter to you and Linda? Education, health care, environment?

00:15:36.726 --> 00:15:40.429
SPEAKER_01: We've always supported the local hospital.

00:15:43.496 --> 00:15:53.946
SPEAKER_00: Perfect. You could leave them a specific bequest, or even a percentage of your estate. Just make sure they're a registered charity.

00:15:55.726 --> 00:15:58.080
SPEAKER_01: How do I check that?

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:06.857
SPEAKER_00: CRA has a database of registered charities online. Pretty easy to search.

00:16:12.726 --> 00:16:15.522
SPEAKER_01: What about taxes on Linda's death?

00:16:18.496 --> 00:16:28.947
SPEAKER_00: Same issues, but potentially worse because she'd inherit your assets too. That's why it's important to start tax planning now.

00:16:30.447 --> 00:16:34.430
SPEAKER_01: Should we be more aggressive about RRSP withdrawals?

00:16:36.057 --> 00:16:47.367
SPEAKER_00: Maybe. If you can-- if you can withdraw at lower tax rates now versus higher rates later, it makes sense. What's your current marginal rate?

00:16:48.867 --> 00:16:53.010
SPEAKER_01: About forty-three percent combined federal and provincial.

00:16:54.637 --> 00:17:00.618
SPEAKER_00: So pretty high already. But in retirement it might be lower if your income drops significantly.

00:17:07.095 --> 00:17:09.383
SPEAKER_01: What about pension splitting?

00:17:13.705 --> 00:17:21.081
SPEAKER_00: Good point. Once you're sixty-five, you can split eligible pension income with Linda. Helps level out tax brackets.

00:17:26.095 --> 00:17:27.968
SPEAKER_01: Eligible pension income?

00:17:30.665 --> 00:17:36.326
SPEAKER_00: RRIF withdrawals, annuity payments, employer pension payments. But not RRSP withdrawals before they become RRIFs.

00:17:44.095 --> 00:17:46.843
SPEAKER_01: When do RRSPs have to become RRIFs?

00:17:49.705 --> 00:17:58.618
SPEAKER_00: End of the year you turn seventy-one. Then you're forced to take minimum withdrawals annually.

00:17:59.095 --> 00:18:01.693
SPEAKER_01: How much are the minimums?

00:18:04.865 --> 00:18:16.347
SPEAKER_00: Starts around five percent at seventy-two, increases each year. By age ninety it's over ten percent. Can create big tax bills.

00:18:17.847 --> 00:18:20.748
SPEAKER_01: So better to start withdrawals earlier voluntarily?

00:18:23.457 --> 00:18:34.177
SPEAKER_00: Often, yes. Gives you more control over the timing and amounts. Plus you can reinvest the after-tax money in TFSAs or non-registered accounts.

00:18:35.847 --> 00:18:41.337
SPEAKER_01: This is getting complicated. Should we work with an estate lawyer?

00:18:42.837 --> 00:18:53.287
SPEAKER_00: For updating your wills and powers of attorney, absolutely. They'll make sure everything's properly documented and legally valid.

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:57.871
SPEAKER_01: Any other professionals we should involve?

00:19:00.677 --> 00:19:11.397
SPEAKER_00: Maybe an accountant who specializes in estate tax planning. They can model different scenarios and help optimize the timing of withdrawals.

00:19:13.067 --> 00:19:15.555
SPEAKER_01: And you'll coordinate with them?

00:19:17.637 --> 00:19:24.076
SPEAKER_00: Of course. Estate planning works best when everyone's on the same page - lawyer, accountant, financial advisor.

00:19:30.067 --> 00:19:32.153
SPEAKER_01: What's our next step?

00:19:35.677 --> 00:19:44.951
SPEAKER_00: I'd suggest we run some projections on different withdrawal strategies from your RRSPs. Then you can make informed decisions about timing.

00:19:49.067 --> 00:19:52.009
SPEAKER_01: And get those wills updated.

00:19:53.637 --> 00:20:00.894
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Ten years is a long time. Your asset values have grown significantly, and the tax implications have changed too.

00:20:06.067 --> 00:20:10.617
SPEAKER_01: Thanks for explaining all this. It's a lot too digest.

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:22.397
SPEAKER_00: Estate planning isn't glamorous, but it's one of the most important things you can do for your family. Better to plan now while you have options.

00:20:24.067 --> 00:20:27.837
SPEAKER_01: I'll talk to Linda about all this tonight.

00:20:28.637 --> 00:20:35.598
SPEAKER_00: Good. And don't hesitate to call if you have questions as you think through everything.
