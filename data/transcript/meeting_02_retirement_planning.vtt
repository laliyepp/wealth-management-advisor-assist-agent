WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:09.922
SPEAKER_00: Thanks for coming in, uh, how's retirement treating you so far? I know it's been... what, six months now?

00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:18.970
SPEAKER_01: Well, that's actually why I'm here. I'm getting... I'm getting really nervous about my numbers.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:29.977
SPEAKER_00: Okay, let's dive into it. You retired at sixty-two, right? About... um... six months ago? Let me check my notes here...

00:00:31.477 --> 00:00:39.723
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I couldn't take the stress at work anymore. But now I'm stressed about money instead.

00:00:41.223 --> 00:00:50.912
SPEAKER_00: Understandable. So you've got, what, about... let me see... eight hundred thousand in your 401k and IRA combined? Is that still current?

00:00:52.412 --> 00:00:57.162
SPEAKER_01: Eight twenty-five as of last month. Market's been volatile.

00:00:57.212 --> 00:01:12.540
SPEAKER_00: Right, and you're not taking Social Security yet. That's actually smart - your benefit grows... um... eight percent each year until seventy. Or is it seven point five? I should double-check that.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.132
SPEAKER_01: But I need income now. I've been living off savings and it's... it's draining fast.

00:01:23.632 --> 00:01:32.840
SPEAKER_00: How much are you spending monthly? We need to figure out your, um, burn rate. Do you have those numbers handy?

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:43.953
SPEAKER_01: About forty-five hundred a month. House is paid off, but taxes, utilities, food... it all adds up, you know?

00:01:45.453 --> 00:01:53.115
SPEAKER_00: So fifty-four thousand annually. That's actually pretty reasonable for your lifestyle. Some clients spend way more than-- than that.

00:01:54.615 --> 00:02:01.971
SPEAKER_01: Really? It feels like a lot when I'm not earning anything. Every purchase makes me... makes me anxious.

00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:15.705
SPEAKER_00: Well, the four percent rule suggests you could safely withdraw about, let me see... thirty-three thousand from your portfolio. Actually, wait, that's based on eight twenty-five, so... um, let me recalculate that.

00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:23.872
SPEAKER_01: That's only twenty-seven fifty a month. I need more than-- way more than that.

00:02:25.372 --> 00:02:36.159
SPEAKER_00: Right, which is why we need to bridge you to Social Security. What will your benefit be at full retirement age? Did you bring that statement?

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:46.772
SPEAKER_01: Um, the estimate says about twenty-eight hundred a month. At least I think that's what it said.

00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:59.340
SPEAKER_00: And that's at sixty-seven. If you wait until seventy, it would be around... um... thirty-six hundred. That's a rough estimate though.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.590
SPEAKER_01: Eight hundred more per month just for waiting three years?

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.790
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. That's an extra nine thousand six hundred annually, guaranteed for life. Hard to beat that return.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.713
SPEAKER_01: But I need money now, not in eight years. I can't wait that long.

00:03:20.213 --> 00:03:28.890
SPEAKER_00: I understand. So let's create a bridge strategy. Maybe a more aggressive withdrawal rate early on, though that's... that's riskier.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.479
SPEAKER_01: More aggressive? I don't-- I mean, how risky are we talking here? I'm already losing sleep over this.

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.834
SPEAKER_01: How aggressive are we talking?

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:57.660
SPEAKER_00: Well, you could withdraw five percent now, then dial it back when Social Security kicks in. Though, um, let me double-check those withdrawal rates... I think five percent is still considered safe-ish for short periods.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:08.234
SPEAKER_01: Five percent of eight twenty-five... that's about forty-one thousand. Still short of what I need.

00:04:09.734 --> 00:04:19.056
SPEAKER_00: Right, plus you probably have some other assets. Don't you own some rental properties? Or did you sell those already?

00:04:20.556 --> 00:04:30.495
SPEAKER_01: Just one now. Sold the other two last year. Net about six hundred a month after... after all the expenses.

00:04:31.995 --> 00:04:45.026
SPEAKER_00: Okay, so that's seven thousand two hundred annually. So we need about... let's see... six thousand eight hundred more. Wait, is my math right there? Let me double-check...

00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:54.053
SPEAKER_01: That doesn't seem too bad when you put it that way. Though I'm still-- still worried.

00:04:55.553 --> 00:05:08.640
SPEAKER_00: It's not. But we need to be strategic about which accounts we tap first. Have you heard of the bucket strategy? It's... it's pretty popular these days.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.273
SPEAKER_01: No, what's that?

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:23.030
SPEAKER_00: Think of your money in three buckets. Short-term cash, medium-term bonds, long-term stocks. It's a... it's a pretty common strategy these days.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:31.170
SPEAKER_01: So I don't have to sell stocks when the market's down? That's-- that's the idea?

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:43.528
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. You've got five years of expenses in cash and bonds, stocks have time to recover from downturns. At least that's... that's the theory anyway.

00:05:45.028 --> 00:05:50.227
SPEAKER_01: Makes sense. What's my allocation now? I haven't really been paying attention.

00:05:50.698 --> 00:06:03.371
SPEAKER_00: Looking at your statements, you're about... um... sixty-forty stocks to bonds. Pretty standard for your age. Though maybe we should-- actually, let me look at this closer.

00:06:04.871 --> 00:06:10.451
SPEAKER_01: Is that too aggressive for retirement? I mean, should I be more--

00:06:10.901 --> 00:06:20.121
SPEAKER_00: Actually, with your timeline, maybe not aggressive enough. You could live another thirty years. Or more, who knows with medical advances these days.

00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:26.371
SPEAKER_01: Thirty years? God, I hope I don't run out of money.

00:06:26.921 --> 00:06:34.426
SPEAKER_00: That's why we need growth. Inflation alone will cut your purchasing power in half over twenty years.

00:06:35.926 --> 00:06:38.211
SPEAKER_01: Even at two percent inflation?

00:06:40.226 --> 00:06:47.376
SPEAKER_00: Well, core CPI is running over three percent now. And healthcare inflation is historically much higher.

00:06:47.926 --> 00:06:52.234
SPEAKER_01: Don't remind me. My insurance premiums just went up fifteen percent.

00:06:52.726 --> 00:06:59.688
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. That's why I'm thinking maybe seventy-thirty stocks to bonds for the long-term bucket.

00:06:59.926 --> 00:07:02.269
SPEAKER_01: And the short-term money?

00:07:04.726 --> 00:07:10.876
SPEAKER_00: High-yield savings, maybe some CDs. You can get over four percent risk-free right now.

00:07:11.926 --> 00:07:15.676
SPEAKER_01: That's better than my bonds are doing.

00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:22.876
SPEAKER_00: Bond funds have been rough with rates rising. But they'll do better when rates eventually fall.

00:07:23.926 --> 00:07:27.676
SPEAKER_01: When do you think that'll happen?

00:07:28.726 --> 00:07:44.090
SPEAKER_00: Your guess is as good as mine. Fed funds is at five and a quarter. Could stay there a while if inflation persists. I honestly-- I honestly don't know. Nobody does.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.087
SPEAKER_01: This interest rate stuff is confusing.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:58.665
SPEAKER_00: Think of it this way - higher rates are actually good for retirees with cash. Bad for bond prices, though.

00:08:00.165 --> 00:08:03.915
SPEAKER_01: So should I sell my bond funds?

00:08:04.965 --> 00:08:11.115
SPEAKER_00: Not necessarily. Maybe shift some to shorter duration bonds. They're less sensitive to rate changes.

00:08:12.165 --> 00:08:15.915
SPEAKER_01: What about I Bonds? I keep hearing about those.

00:08:16.965 --> 00:08:27.534
SPEAKER_00: Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities? They're great, but you can only buy ten thousand per year. Or is it... wait, let me check if that limit changed recently.

00:08:29.034 --> 00:08:31.521
SPEAKER_01: Still, ten thousand is ten thousand.

00:08:33.834 --> 00:08:39.984
SPEAKER_00: True. They're paying about five percent now, and they adjust for inflation. Can't beat that.

00:08:41.034 --> 00:08:44.784
SPEAKER_01: I should have bought them years ago.

00:08:45.834 --> 00:08:56.569
SPEAKER_00: Nobody saw this inflation coming. Even the Fed called it transitory, remember? That was... that was completely wrong. Shows you how hard this stuff is to predict.

00:08:58.069 --> 00:09:00.474
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that didn't age well.

00:09:02.869 --> 00:09:09.019
SPEAKER_00: Point is, we can't predict everything. That's why diversification is so important.

00:09:10.069 --> 00:09:13.819
SPEAKER_01: Speaking of which, what about international stocks?

00:09:14.869 --> 00:09:21.019
SPEAKER_00: You've got very little international exposure. Maybe fifteen percent of your stock allocation should be overseas.

00:09:22.069 --> 00:09:25.819
SPEAKER_01: Haven't they been underperforming the US for years?

00:09:26.869 --> 00:09:33.019
SPEAKER_00: They have, but valuations are much cheaper now. European stocks are trading at thirteen times earnings.

00:09:34.069 --> 00:09:36.383
SPEAKER_01: Versus what for US stocks?

00:09:38.869 --> 00:09:45.019
SPEAKER_00: S&P 500 is at about twenty-four times. Emerging markets are even cheaper at twelve times.

00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:49.819
SPEAKER_01: So they're due for a comeback?

00:09:50.869 --> 00:09:57.019
SPEAKER_00: Maybe. Currencies could be a headwind, but from a valuation standpoint, they look attractive.

00:09:58.069 --> 00:10:01.819
SPEAKER_01: I'm not a big risk-taker at this point.

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:09.770
SPEAKER_00: Understood. But not diversifying is also a risk. What if the US has a decade like Japan in the nineties?

00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:13.819
SPEAKER_01: Their stock market went nowhere for ten years, right?

00:10:14.869 --> 00:10:23.072
SPEAKER_00: Longer than that, actually. The Nikkei peaked in nineteen eighty-nine and didn't recover until twenty eighteen.

00:10:24.572 --> 00:10:28.322
SPEAKER_01: Jesus. Okay, some international exposure makes sense.

00:10:29.372 --> 00:10:36.083
SPEAKER_00: Good. Now, let's talk about tax-efficient withdrawals. You've got both traditional and Roth accounts, right?

00:10:36.572 --> 00:10:40.322
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, about two-thirds traditional, one-third Roth.

00:10:41.372 --> 00:10:47.522
SPEAKER_00: Perfect. In low-income years like now, you want to withdraw from traditional accounts first.

00:10:48.572 --> 00:10:52.322
SPEAKER_01: To fill up the lower tax brackets?

00:10:53.372 --> 00:10:59.522
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. The twelve percent bracket goes up to about twenty-two thousand for a single person.

00:11:00.572 --> 00:11:05.446
SPEAKER_01: So I should withdraw at least that much from my 401k?

00:11:06.946 --> 00:11:16.386
SPEAKER_00: Probably more. Remember, you'll have standard deduction of thirteen thousand eight fifty, so no tax on that.

00:11:17.886 --> 00:11:22.425
SPEAKER_01: So I could withdraw thirty-five thousand and only pay twelve percent?

00:11:22.686 --> 00:11:31.153
SPEAKER_00: On the taxable portion, yes. That's way less than you'll pay when RMDs kick in at seventy-three.

00:11:32.653 --> 00:11:34.819
SPEAKER_01: RMDs? Required minimum distributions?

00:11:37.453 --> 00:11:43.603
SPEAKER_00: Right. The IRS forces you to withdraw a percentage each year. Starts at about four percent.

00:11:44.653 --> 00:11:49.790
SPEAKER_01: So I'll have to pay taxes whether I want to or not.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:12:00.877
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. That's why it makes sense to do some Roth conversions now while you're in a low bracket.

00:12:02.377 --> 00:12:05.494
SPEAKER_01: Convert traditional IRA money to Roth?

00:12:07.177 --> 00:12:13.327
SPEAKER_00: Yes. Pay taxes now at twelve percent instead of potentially twenty-two or twenty-four percent later.

00:12:14.377 --> 00:12:19.857
SPEAKER_01: But that means more taxes now when money's already tight.

00:12:21.357 --> 00:12:30.263
SPEAKER_00: I know it's counterintuitive. But it's like prepaying at a discount. Plus, Roth money doesn't have RMDs.

00:12:31.763 --> 00:12:35.513
SPEAKER_01: And I can leave it to my kids tax-free?

00:12:36.563 --> 00:12:44.151
SPEAKER_00: Well, they'll have to withdraw it over ten years now, but yeah, no taxes on the withdrawals.

00:12:45.651 --> 00:12:49.401
SPEAKER_01: That's still better than leaving them a tax bill.

00:12:50.451 --> 00:12:56.601
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely. Especially if they're in high-earning years. Could save them a fortune.

00:12:57.651 --> 00:13:01.401
SPEAKER_01: Okay, I'm sold on some conversions.

00:13:02.451 --> 00:13:10.333
SPEAKER_00: Great. Maybe we do twenty thousand a year for the next few years. Stay in that twelve percent bracket.

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:15.583
SPEAKER_01: And I'd pay about twenty-four hundred in taxes?

00:13:16.633 --> 00:13:21.071
SPEAKER_00: Something like that. Small price to pay for future tax flexibility.

00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:27.583
SPEAKER_01: This is a lot to think about.

00:13:28.633 --> 00:13:34.783
SPEAKER_00: I know. But having a plan reduces the stress. You're not just winging it anymore.

00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:38.237
SPEAKER_01: True. What about healthcare costs?

00:13:40.633 --> 00:13:50.493
SPEAKER_00: Big concern. Fidelity estimates a sixty-five-year-old couple needs three hundred thousand for medical expenses in retirement.

00:13:51.993 --> 00:13:54.590
SPEAKER_01: Three hundred thousand? That's terrifying.

00:13:56.793 --> 00:14:02.943
SPEAKER_00: It includes insurance premiums, not just out-of-pocket costs. But yeah, it's substantial.

00:14:03.993 --> 00:14:07.743
SPEAKER_01: Thank god I've got decent coverage now.

00:14:08.793 --> 00:14:14.943
SPEAKER_00: What are you paying? And remember, Medicare doesn't start until sixty-five.

00:14:15.993 --> 00:14:19.943
SPEAKER_01: I'm on COBRA for now. About eight hundred a month.

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:26.943
SPEAKER_00: That's actually not bad. Marketplace plans for someone your age can be twelve hundred or more.

00:14:27.993 --> 00:14:31.743
SPEAKER_01: I've got two more years of COBRA eligibility.

00:14:32.793 --> 00:14:38.943
SPEAKER_00: Good, that bridges you to Medicare. Though you might want to look at ACA plans to compare.

00:14:39.993 --> 00:14:43.743
SPEAKER_01: Depending on income, I might qualify for subsidies?

00:14:44.793 --> 00:14:50.943
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. If your modified AGI is under fifty-one thousand, you'd get premium assistance.

00:14:51.993 --> 00:14:55.743
SPEAKER_01: Another reason to manage my withdrawal strategy carefully.

00:14:56.793 --> 00:15:05.906
SPEAKER_00: Right. Too much income and you lose subsidies. Too little and you're not optimizing your tax situation.

00:15:07.406 --> 00:15:10.219
SPEAKER_01: It's like walking a tightrope.

00:15:12.206 --> 00:15:18.356
SPEAKER_00: A bit, yeah. But that's where good planning pays off. Small moves can save thousands.

00:15:19.406 --> 00:15:21.624
SPEAKER_01: What about long-term care insurance?

00:15:24.206 --> 00:15:33.826
SPEAKER_00: Good question. The average stay is about three years at around ninety thousand annually. Actually, let me... let me verify those numbers. They might be outdated.

00:15:35.126 --> 00:15:38.155
SPEAKER_01: So two hundred seventy thousand total?

00:15:39.926 --> 00:15:46.076
SPEAKER_00: For nursing home care, yeah. Home care is less expensive but still substantial.

00:15:47.126 --> 00:15:50.876
SPEAKER_01: Is insurance worth it at my age?

00:15:51.926 --> 00:15:58.076
SPEAKER_00: Premiums are expensive, and they can increase over time. But it protects your other assets.

00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:01.202
SPEAKER_01: What would something basic cost?

00:16:03.926 --> 00:16:14.010
SPEAKER_00: For a sixty-two-year-old male, maybe three to four thousand annually for decent coverage. Though, uh, those numbers might have changed with recent rate increases.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:19.260
SPEAKER_01: That's a significant chunk of my budget.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:26.460
SPEAKER_00: It is. Alternative is to self-insure - keep extra cash for potential care needs.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:31.260
SPEAKER_01: I think I'd rather stay flexible.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:38.460
SPEAKER_00: Fair enough. Just factor it into your planning. Maybe keep an extra hundred thousand in conservative investments.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:46.480
SPEAKER_01: That makes sense. Oh, before I forget-- my daughter's been asking about my finances lately too.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:57.922
SPEAKER_00: Oh? Well, it's good she's concerned-- um, alright, let me summarize what we've discussed. Bridge strategy until Social Security, bucket approach for withdrawals...

00:16:59.422 --> 00:17:01.931
SPEAKER_01: Some international diversification, Roth conversions...

00:17:04.222 --> 00:17:10.378
SPEAKER_00: Right, and careful attention to tax brackets and healthcare subsidy thresholds.

00:17:11.422 --> 00:17:14.347
SPEAKER_01: When should we implement all this?

00:17:16.222 --> 00:17:27.211
SPEAKER_00: We can start gradually. Maybe begin with moving some money to higher-yield cash accounts. No need to rush into everything at once.

00:17:28.711 --> 00:17:30.899
SPEAKER_01: And then tackle the portfolio rebalancing?

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:40.597
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. No need to do everything at once. Rome wasn't built in a day, as they say.

00:17:40.711 --> 00:17:44.461
SPEAKER_01: I feel much better having a roadmap.

00:17:45.511 --> 00:17:54.660
SPEAKER_00: Good. Retirement shouldn't be about constant worry. You've done well saving for this phase of your life.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.910
SPEAKER_01: I just wish I'd started planning sooner.

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:12.518
SPEAKER_00: Second-best time to plant a tree is today, right? We'll get you set up for a comfortable retirement. I'm confident we can make this work.

00:18:14.018 --> 00:18:17.106
SPEAKER_01: Thanks. This has been really helpful.

00:18:18.818 --> 00:18:29.373
SPEAKER_00: My pleasure. Let's schedule a follow-up in, um, about a month to see how the plan is working out for you.

00:18:30.873 --> 00:18:34.623
SPEAKER_01: Perfect. I'll bring my latest statements.

00:18:35.673 --> 00:18:40.006
SPEAKER_00: Sounds good. Try to enjoy your retirement - you've definitely earned it.
