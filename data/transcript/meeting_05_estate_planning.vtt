00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:10.029
SPEAKER_00: Good morning Robert, thanks for bringing Linda with you today. I know estate planning can be a sensitive topic for couples.

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:18.879
SPEAKER_01: We're not getting any younger. We figured it's time to get serious about this.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:25.949
SPEAKER_02: Especially with the new grandkid coming. We want to make sure everyone's taken care of.

00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:35.735
SPEAKER_00: Congratulations on the grandchild! That's often what motivates people to, uh, finally tackle estate planning.

00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:44.286
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, when you realize there's a whole new generation depending on you, it puts things in perspective.

00:00:44.786 --> 00:00:52.058
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely. So let's start with the basics. Do you currently have wills or any estate documents?

00:00:52.558 --> 00:01:00.717
SPEAKER_02: We have wills from about ten years ago, but they're probably outdated. A lot has changed since then.

00:01:01.217 --> 00:01:06.967
SPEAKER_00: That's common. What kind of changes are we talking about?

00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:17.555
SPEAKER_01: Our net worth has grown significantly. We sold our business three years ago for approximately... um... two point five million.

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:22.658
SPEAKER_00: Congratulations. So you're potentially looking at federal estate tax issues now?

00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:31.280
SPEAKER_02: That's what we're worried about. We don't really understand how it all works.

00:01:34.525 --> 00:01:45.014
SPEAKER_00: No worries, that's what I'm here for. The federal exemption is twelve point nine two million per person this year.

00:01:45.514 --> 00:01:51.465
SPEAKER_01: So twenty-five point eight four million for a married couple?

00:01:52.164 --> 00:02:01.099
SPEAKER_00: Exactly, if you plan properly. But here's the catch - those limits are set to drop significantly after twenty twenty-five.

00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:05.236
SPEAKER_02: Drop to what?

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.828
SPEAKER_00: Probably around six to seven million per person, adjusted for inflation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions expire.

00:02:19.337 --> 00:02:25.487
SPEAKER_01: So we could go from being under the limit to being over it, just like that?

00:02:25.987 --> 00:02:32.287
SPEAKER_00: Potentially, yes. What's your total net worth currently, if you don't mind me asking?

00:02:32.787 --> 00:02:39.487
SPEAKER_02: Between the sale proceeds, our retirement accounts, and real estate, probably around four point two million.

00:02:39.987 --> 00:02:51.114
SPEAKER_00: So you're likely safe under current rules, but if the exemption drops and your assets continue growing, you could face significant tax liability.

00:02:51.614 --> 00:02:57.764
SPEAKER_01: We could have a problem then. What's the tax rate on estates?

00:02:58.264 --> 00:03:02.470
SPEAKER_00: Forty percent on amounts over the exemption. It's quite substantial.

00:03:05.064 --> 00:03:09.764
SPEAKER_02: Forty percent? That's higher than our income tax rate!

00:03:10.264 --> 00:03:19.228
SPEAKER_00: It is. The good news is there are strategies we can implement now while the exemptions are still high.

00:03:19.728 --> 00:03:22.105
SPEAKER_01: Like what kind of strategies?

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:33.675
SPEAKER_00: Gifting is the most straightforward. You can each give eighteen thousand per recipient per year without using your lifetime exemption.

00:03:34.175 --> 00:03:40.325
SPEAKER_02: So we could give thirty-six thousand to our daughter and her husband each year?

00:03:40.825 --> 00:03:46.562
SPEAKER_00: Each year, yes. Plus another thirty-six thousand to each grandchild.

00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:54.806
SPEAKER_01: So if we have two grandkids eventually, that's, what, a hundred and eight thousand annually?

00:03:55.306 --> 00:04:02.056
SPEAKER_00: Right. And it removes that money from your taxable estate, plus any future growth.

00:04:02.556 --> 00:04:08.256
SPEAKER_02: But what if we need that money for our own retirement? That's my main concern.

00:04:09.306 --> 00:04:15.056
SPEAKER_00: That's the key question. You never want to compromise your own financial security.

00:04:16.106 --> 00:04:24.301
SPEAKER_01: We've run the numbers. We think we can live comfortably on about two hundred thousand annually.

00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:31.551
SPEAKER_00: And your assets should generate that through a combination of investment returns and withdrawals?

00:04:32.601 --> 00:04:41.198
SPEAKER_02: Yeah, we're thinking a four percent withdrawal rate. That's about a hundred sixty thousand, plus Social Security benefits.

00:04:42.698 --> 00:04:46.569
SPEAKER_00: And what will your combined Social Security benefits be?

00:04:49.498 --> 00:04:54.648
SPEAKER_01: About sixty thousand annually once we both file at full retirement age.

00:04:55.698 --> 00:05:01.448
SPEAKER_00: So you'd have a buffer there. That's good. Makes gifting more feasible.

00:05:02.498 --> 00:05:07.648
SPEAKER_02: What about bigger gifts? Can we give more than the annual limit?

00:05:08.698 --> 00:05:15.823
SPEAKER_00: You can, but it uses up your lifetime exemption. Though with the current high limits, that might actually make sense.

00:05:17.323 --> 00:05:20.955
SPEAKER_01: How much could we give without triggering taxes?

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:31.441
SPEAKER_00: Well, you could each gift up to twelve point nine two million over your lifetime without estate tax.

00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:39.580
SPEAKER_02: So we could give away a million dollars now and still be under the limit?

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:48.539
SPEAKER_00: Correct. And if the exemption drops in twenty twenty-six, you'll have locked in the higher limit, which is smart.

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.558
SPEAKER_01: That's like grandfathering in the current rules?

00:05:56.239 --> 00:06:05.676
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. It's called 'use it or lose it' planning. Once the exemption drops, you can't go back.

00:06:07.176 --> 00:06:11.217
SPEAKER_02: But giving away a million dollars seems quite daunting to us.

00:06:13.376 --> 00:06:19.404
SPEAKER_00: Understandable. We could start smaller and build up to it. Maybe two hundred thousand this year.

00:06:20.176 --> 00:06:23.559
SPEAKER_01: And put it in trust for the grandkids?

00:06:26.376 --> 00:06:32.126
SPEAKER_00: That's one option. A five twenty-nine education savings plan is another.

00:06:33.176 --> 00:06:38.326
SPEAKER_02: What's the advantage of a trust versus five twenty-nine?

00:06:39.376 --> 00:06:47.844
SPEAKER_00: Trusts offer more control and flexibility. Five twenty-nines are simpler but they're limited to education expenses.

00:06:49.344 --> 00:06:54.494
SPEAKER_01: Can you do a lump sum contribution to a five twenty-nine?

00:06:55.544 --> 00:07:02.721
SPEAKER_00: Yes, you can contribute up to ninety thousand at once by using five years' worth of annual exclusions.

00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:08.818
SPEAKER_02: So a hundred eighty thousand for both of us?

00:07:10.421 --> 00:07:16.171
SPEAKER_00: Per beneficiary, yes. So if you have two grandkids, that's three hundred sixty thousand total.

00:07:17.221 --> 00:07:21.066
SPEAKER_01: And it grows tax-free if used for education?

00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:29.171
SPEAKER_00: Right. Plus you maintain some control - you can change beneficiaries if needed.

00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:35.371
SPEAKER_02: What happens if the kids don't go to college?

00:07:36.421 --> 00:07:45.271
SPEAKER_00: You can withdraw the money, but you'll pay taxes plus a ten percent penalty on the gains.

00:07:46.771 --> 00:07:49.586
SPEAKER_01: Or transfer it to another family member?

00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:56.492
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Nieces, nephews, even yourself for continuing education.

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.538
SPEAKER_02: That seems pretty flexible.

00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:15.613
SPEAKER_00: It is. Now, let's talk about your retirement accounts. How much do you have in IRAs and four-oh-one-ks?

00:08:17.113 --> 00:08:21.051
SPEAKER_01: About one point eight million combined. Mostly traditional accounts.

00:08:23.313 --> 00:08:29.063
SPEAKER_00: Those will be subject to required minimum distributions starting at seventy-three.

00:08:30.113 --> 00:08:33.340
SPEAKER_02: Which means more taxable income for us, right?

00:08:36.313 --> 00:08:42.063
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. And your heirs will have to withdraw everything within ten years now.

00:08:43.113 --> 00:08:46.311
SPEAKER_01: That could push them into higher tax brackets?

00:08:49.313 --> 00:08:57.543
SPEAKER_00: Very likely. Might be worth considering some Roth conversions now while you're in lower tax brackets.

00:08:59.043 --> 00:09:04.193
SPEAKER_02: We're essentially retired, so our income is pretty low.

00:09:05.243 --> 00:09:12.724
SPEAKER_00: Perfect time for conversions. You could convert up to the top of the twelve percent bracket quite cost-effectively.

00:09:14.224 --> 00:09:16.253
SPEAKER_01: How much is that?

00:09:20.424 --> 00:09:26.174
SPEAKER_00: For married filing jointly, about eighty-three thousand in taxable income.

00:09:27.224 --> 00:09:30.965
SPEAKER_02: So we could convert maybe sixty thousand per year?

00:09:33.424 --> 00:09:41.809
SPEAKER_00: Depends on your other income, but that's in the ballpark. Over ten years, that's six hundred thousand.

00:09:45.448 --> 00:09:48.161
SPEAKER_01: And our kids inherit it tax-free?

00:09:51.648 --> 00:09:59.634
SPEAKER_00: Right. Plus it reduces the size of your traditional IRA, which could help with estate taxes later.

00:10:01.134 --> 00:10:06.284
SPEAKER_02: This is getting complicated. Should we really be working with an estate attorney?

00:10:07.334 --> 00:10:13.084
SPEAKER_00: Absolutely. I can help with the financial planning, but you'll need legal documents.

00:10:14.134 --> 00:10:17.665
SPEAKER_01: What kind of documents are we talking about?

00:10:20.334 --> 00:10:26.084
SPEAKER_00: Updated wills, probably a revocable living trust, powers of attorney, healthcare directives.

00:10:27.134 --> 00:10:32.284
SPEAKER_02: What's the advantage of a trust over just having wills?

00:10:33.334 --> 00:10:39.084
SPEAKER_00: Trusts avoid probate, provide more privacy, and can be more efficient for managing assets.

00:10:40.134 --> 00:10:42.376
SPEAKER_01: Is probate really that bad?

00:10:46.334 --> 00:10:55.442
SPEAKER_00: Depends on the state. Some states have quick and inexpensive probate, while others can take years and cost tens of thousands of dollars.

00:10:55.826 --> 00:11:00.976
SPEAKER_02: We're in California. I've heard probate here is quite expensive.

00:11:02.026 --> 00:11:10.411
SPEAKER_00: It can be. Statutory fees alone could be fifty thousand or more on a four million dollar estate.

00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:17.061
SPEAKER_01: Fifty thousand? That's a significant amount to lose to fees.

00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:23.861
SPEAKER_00: Plus it's all public record. Anyone can see what you owned and who inherited what.

00:11:24.911 --> 00:11:27.879
SPEAKER_02: We definitely value our privacy.

00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:36.861
SPEAKER_00: Then a trust makes sense. You can transfer assets now and avoid the whole probate process.

00:11:37.911 --> 00:11:41.028
SPEAKER_01: Do we lose control of our assets?

00:11:44.111 --> 00:11:52.432
SPEAKER_00: Not with a revocable trust. You're the trustees, so you maintain complete control while you're both alive.

00:11:53.932 --> 00:11:57.434
SPEAKER_02: And then what happens when we're both gone?

00:12:00.132 --> 00:12:05.882
SPEAKER_00: Your successor trustee distributes assets according to your instructions. Could be immediate or over time.

00:12:06.932 --> 00:12:12.082
SPEAKER_01: We're worried about our daughter getting everything at once. That concerns us.

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:23.134
SPEAKER_00: Understandable. You could structure it to distribute in stages - like one-third at twenty-five, one-third at thirty, one-third at thirty-five.

00:12:24.634 --> 00:12:29.784
SPEAKER_02: Or tie it to milestones like graduating college or getting married?

00:12:30.834 --> 00:12:36.584
SPEAKER_00: You can do that, though some attorneys actually discourage tying distributions to personal choices.

00:12:37.634 --> 00:12:39.495
SPEAKER_01: Why's that?

00:12:43.834 --> 00:12:51.833
SPEAKER_00: It can create perverse incentives. What if she chooses not to marry or pursues a different path than college?

00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:56.987
SPEAKER_02: Good point. Age-based distributions might be simpler.

00:12:59.533 --> 00:13:05.283
SPEAKER_00: They are. Plus the trustee can always make discretionary distributions for health, education, or emergencies.

00:13:06.333 --> 00:13:09.434
SPEAKER_01: Who should be the successor trustee?

00:13:12.533 --> 00:13:18.283
SPEAKER_00: Often a family member, but you could also use a corporate trustee or a combination.

00:13:19.333 --> 00:13:22.636
SPEAKER_02: What are the pros and cons?

00:13:25.533 --> 00:13:31.283
SPEAKER_00: Family trustees are free but may lack expertise. Corporate trustees are professional but charge fees.

00:13:32.333 --> 00:13:35.828
SPEAKER_01: How much do corporate trustees typically charge?

00:13:38.533 --> 00:13:46.249
SPEAKER_00: Usually around one percent of assets annually. So on four million, that's about forty thousand per year.

00:13:47.749 --> 00:13:50.195
SPEAKER_02: That seems like a lot.

00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:59.699
SPEAKER_00: It is, but they handle all the administrative work, tax filings, investment management.

00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:05.899
SPEAKER_01: Maybe we start with family and switch to corporate if needed?

00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:12.699
SPEAKER_00: That's possible. You can build successor provisions into the trust document.

00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:17.337
SPEAKER_02: What about life insurance? Do we need that?

00:14:19.949 --> 00:14:25.699
SPEAKER_00: Depends. If you have estate tax exposure, life insurance can provide liquidity to pay taxes.

00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:32.987
SPEAKER_01: We used to have life insurance when we had the business, but we let it lapse.

00:14:34.487 --> 00:14:40.237
SPEAKER_00: At your age, new policies will be expensive and might not be cost-effective.

00:14:41.287 --> 00:14:46.064
SPEAKER_02: What if we end up with estate tax liability?

00:14:47.487 --> 00:14:53.237
SPEAKER_00: Your executor could sell assets to pay the taxes. Not ideal, but workable.

00:14:54.287 --> 00:14:58.682
SPEAKER_01: Better than paying expensive insurance premiums for twenty years?

00:15:00.487 --> 00:15:06.237
SPEAKER_00: Probably. Though we could run some scenarios to see if it ever makes sense.

00:15:07.287 --> 00:15:09.924
SPEAKER_02: This has been very informative.

00:15:13.487 --> 00:15:22.614
SPEAKER_00: Good. Estate planning isn't just about taxes - it's about making sure your wishes are carried out.

00:15:24.114 --> 00:15:26.224
SPEAKER_01: And protecting our family.

00:15:30.314 --> 00:15:39.027
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Let me give you a referral to an estate attorney who specializes in situations like yours.

00:15:40.527 --> 00:15:45.677
SPEAKER_02: That would be great. What should we do in the meantime?

00:15:46.727 --> 00:15:52.477
SPEAKER_00: Start thinking about your goals. How much do you want to leave to family versus charity?

00:15:53.527 --> 00:16:03.796
SPEAKER_01: We'd like to leave enough so our kids can pursue their dreams, but not so much they lose motivation.

00:16:05.296 --> 00:16:15.285
SPEAKER_00: That's a common goal. Warren Buffett calls it "enough money to do anything, but not enough to do nothing."

00:16:15.785 --> 00:16:19.493
SPEAKER_02: That's a good way to put it.

00:16:21.097 --> 00:16:30.112
SPEAKER_00: Alright, let me get you that attorney referral, and we can schedule a follow-up after you've met with them.

00:16:32.974 --> 00:16:37.018
SPEAKER_01: Sounds perfect. Thanks for helping us think through all this.

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:45.924
SPEAKER_00: My pleasure. Estate planning can seem overwhelming, but taking it step by step makes it more manageable.

00:16:46.424 --> 00:16:49.660
SPEAKER_02: We feel much better having a roadmap.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.187
SPEAKER_00: That's the goal. Peace of mind for you and security for your family.
