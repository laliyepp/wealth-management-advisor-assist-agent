WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.882
SPEAKER_00: Good afternoon, Lisa. I know you wanted to discuss tax planning before year-end.

00:00:08.382 --> 00:00:14.608
SPEAKER_01: Yes, I'm worried I'm going to owe a huge tax bill. My income jumped this year.

00:00:16.108 --> 00:00:21.258
SPEAKER_00: Congratulations on the promotion. What's your new salary looking like?

00:00:22.308 --> 00:00:27.058
SPEAKER_01: Base is one-forty now, plus I got a forty thousand signing bonus.

00:00:28.108 --> 00:00:35.866
SPEAKER_00: Nice. So you're looking at about one-eighty total. That puts you in the... thirty-two percent bracket.

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:41.116
SPEAKER_01: Thirty-two percent? That seems like a lot.

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:48.316
SPEAKER_00: Well, that's just on income over one-seventy thousand. Your effective rate will be... uh, lower.

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:53.116
SPEAKER_01: Can you walk me through how that works?

00:00:54.166 --> 00:01:04.090
SPEAKER_00: Sure. The first twenty-two thousand is taxed at ten percent, then twelve percent up to eighty-nine thousand...

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.340
SPEAKER_01: So it's like climbing a ladder?

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.540
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Only the income in each bracket gets taxed at that rate. Very common misconception.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.340
SPEAKER_01: That makes me feel a bit better.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:32.511
SPEAKER_00: Good. Now, let's talk about what we can do to reduce your tax burden. Are you maxing out your 401k?

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:37.761
SPEAKER_01: I'm doing ten percent. Company matches up to six.

00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:46.266
SPEAKER_00: So that's eighteen thousand in contributions. The limit this year is twenty-two five, so you could add more.

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:50.398
SPEAKER_01: How much would that save me?

00:01:52.566 --> 00:02:02.252
SPEAKER_00: Every additional dollar saves you thirty-two cents in taxes. So forty-five hundred more would save about... let's see, fourteen forty.

00:02:03.752 --> 00:02:07.502
SPEAKER_01: And the money still grows tax-deferred?

00:02:08.552 --> 00:02:14.702
SPEAKER_00: Right. No taxes until you withdraw in retirement, presumably at a lower rate.

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:18.189
SPEAKER_01: What about a backdoor Roth conversion?

00:02:20.552 --> 00:02:26.702
SPEAKER_00: Good question. At your income level, you can't contribute directly to a Roth IRA anymore.

00:02:27.752 --> 00:02:30.527
SPEAKER_01: The income limits kicked in?

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:40.681
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, phase-out starts at one-twenty-nine thousand for single filers. But you can do a backdoor conversion.

00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:44.101
SPEAKER_01: How does that work exactly?

00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:55.837
SPEAKER_00: You contribute sixty-five hundred to a traditional IRA with after-tax money, then immediately convert to Roth.

00:02:57.337 --> 00:03:01.087
SPEAKER_01: And there's no tax on the conversion?

00:03:02.137 --> 00:03:08.287
SPEAKER_00: Not if you convert right away. The contribution basis is the same as the conversion amount.

00:03:09.337 --> 00:03:11.471
SPEAKER_01: Seems like a loophole.

00:03:14.137 --> 00:03:22.187
SPEAKER_00: Congress has talked about closing it, but for now it's perfectly legal. Even the IRS acknowledges it.

00:03:23.687 --> 00:03:27.437
SPEAKER_01: Okay, that's another sixty-five hundred I can shelter.

00:03:28.487 --> 00:03:34.637
SPEAKER_00: Well, it doesn't reduce your current taxes, but it grows tax-free forever.

00:03:35.687 --> 00:03:39.015
SPEAKER_01: Right, I'm thinking long-term.

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:46.637
SPEAKER_00: Good mindset. Now, what about that signing bonus? Was it paid all at once?

00:03:47.687 --> 00:03:52.765
SPEAKER_01: Yeah, they hit me with the full forty thousand in March.

00:03:54.265 --> 00:04:00.415
SPEAKER_00: Ouch. Bonuses get taxed at the supplemental rate - twenty-two percent federal, plus state and FICA.

00:04:01.465 --> 00:04:05.215
SPEAKER_01: So I probably only netted about twenty-five thousand?

00:04:06.265 --> 00:04:12.867
SPEAKER_00: Something like that. The good news is if you're overwithheld, you'll get a refund when you file.

00:04:13.465 --> 00:04:16.368
SPEAKER_01: What do you mean overwithheld?

00:04:18.265 --> 00:04:24.415
SPEAKER_00: Your actual tax rate might be lower than the twenty-two percent they withheld on the bonus.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:29.215
SPEAKER_01: Oh, because of the marginal tax brackets?

00:04:30.265 --> 00:04:36.415
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Though with your higher income now, you might actually owe more than they withheld overall.

00:04:37.465 --> 00:04:41.215
SPEAKER_01: How can I avoid a big surprise in April?

00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:46.464
SPEAKER_00: Let's run a projection. What state are you in? California?

00:04:49.465 --> 00:04:53.215
SPEAKER_01: Unfortunately, yes. I know the taxes are brutal.

00:04:54.265 --> 00:05:02.417
SPEAKER_00: Top state rate is thirteen point three percent. Plus the one percent surcharge over a million, but... you're not there yet.

00:05:03.917 --> 00:05:05.744
SPEAKER_01: Small mercies, I guess.

00:05:08.717 --> 00:05:15.293
SPEAKER_00: So you're looking at about nine point three percent state tax on the income over eighty-four thousand.

00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:17.896
SPEAKER_01: This is getting complicated.

00:05:20.717 --> 00:05:26.867
SPEAKER_00: It is. That's why we should look at estimated tax payments to avoid underpayment penalties.

00:05:27.917 --> 00:05:31.667
SPEAKER_01: I've never had to do those before.

00:05:32.717 --> 00:05:44.693
SPEAKER_00: Your employer's withholding might not be enough with the income jump. The safe harbor is one-ten percent of last year's tax.

00:05:46.193 --> 00:05:49.943
SPEAKER_01: What did I owe last year? About twelve thousand?

00:05:50.993 --> 00:05:57.520
SPEAKER_00: So you'd need to pay thirteen thousand two hundred in total withholding and estimates to avoid penalties.

00:05:58.193 --> 00:06:02.470
SPEAKER_01: And you think I'll owe more than that this year?

00:06:02.993 --> 00:06:09.970
SPEAKER_00: Probably. Let me rough it out here... federal might be around twenty-eight thousand, state maybe twelve thousand.

00:06:10.193 --> 00:06:13.119
SPEAKER_01: Forty thousand total? That's brutal.

00:06:14.993 --> 00:06:21.143
SPEAKER_00: Yeah, high earners really feel it. But remember, that's on one-eighty thousand of income.

00:06:22.193 --> 00:06:25.943
SPEAKER_01: Still, it's like a luxury car payment.

00:06:26.993 --> 00:06:35.529
SPEAKER_00: I know it stings. Let's focus on what we can control. Any business expenses you can deduct?

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:41.867
SPEAKER_01: I work from home sometimes. Can I claim a home office?

00:06:43.367 --> 00:06:51.001
SPEAKER_00: Only if you're self-employed or it's your principal place of business. Employee home office deductions were eliminated.

00:06:52.501 --> 00:06:54.338
SPEAKER_01: When did that happen?

00:06:57.301 --> 00:07:03.451
SPEAKER_00: Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in twenty-eighteen. Lots of itemized deductions got suspended.

00:07:04.501 --> 00:07:07.441
SPEAKER_01: What about unreimbursed business expenses?

00:07:09.301 --> 00:07:15.451
SPEAKER_00: Same thing. Used to be deductible as a miscellaneous itemized deduction, but not anymore.

00:07:16.501 --> 00:07:18.742
SPEAKER_01: This tax reform really hurt employees.

00:07:21.301 --> 00:07:27.451
SPEAKER_00: In some ways, yeah. Though the standard deduction did double to twelve thousand nine-fifty.

00:07:28.501 --> 00:07:32.251
SPEAKER_01: I've always itemized because of my mortgage.

00:07:33.301 --> 00:07:36.862
SPEAKER_00: How much mortgage interest are you paying? And property taxes?

00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:44.251
SPEAKER_01: About fifteen thousand in interest, eight thousand in property taxes.

00:07:45.301 --> 00:07:51.451
SPEAKER_00: Okay, but remember property taxes are capped at ten thousand for the deduction.

00:07:52.501 --> 00:07:54.632
SPEAKER_01: Right, the SALT limitation.

00:07:57.301 --> 00:08:03.451
SPEAKER_00: So you're looking at twenty-five thousand in itemized deductions, which beats the standard deduction.

00:08:04.501 --> 00:08:06.475
SPEAKER_01: Barely. What about charitable contributions?

00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:15.451
SPEAKER_00: Those still count. How much do you typically give to charity each year?

00:08:16.501 --> 00:08:20.251
SPEAKER_01: Maybe three thousand? I should probably give more.

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:27.451
SPEAKER_00: Well, with your higher income, you could consider bunching donations. Give two years' worth in one year.

00:08:28.501 --> 00:08:31.420
SPEAKER_01: To exceed the standard deduction threshold?

00:08:33.301 --> 00:08:39.451
SPEAKER_00: Right. Give six thousand this year, take the standard deduction next year when you give nothing.

00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:42.670
SPEAKER_01: That seems kind of manipulative.

00:08:45.301 --> 00:08:52.765
SPEAKER_00: It's just tax planning. You're giving the same amount over two years, just optimizing the timing.

00:08:54.265 --> 00:08:56.566
SPEAKER_01: I guess that makes sense.

00:08:59.065 --> 00:09:05.215
SPEAKER_00: You could also look into a donor-advised fund. Contribute appreciated stock instead of cash.

00:09:06.265 --> 00:09:08.749
SPEAKER_01: How does that work?

00:09:11.065 --> 00:09:20.007
SPEAKER_00: You donate stock you've held over a year, get a deduction for the full market value, and avoid capital gains tax.

00:09:21.507 --> 00:09:25.257
SPEAKER_01: So it's like a double tax benefit?

00:09:26.307 --> 00:09:32.457
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Much more efficient than selling stock, paying taxes, then donating the after-tax proceeds.

00:09:33.507 --> 00:09:38.255
SPEAKER_01: I've got some Apple stock that's done really well.

00:09:38.307 --> 00:09:43.605
SPEAKER_00: Perfect candidate. What's your cost basis versus current value?

00:09:45.507 --> 00:09:50.168
SPEAKER_01: I bought it at about fifty dollars, it's at one-ninety now.

00:09:50.307 --> 00:09:58.100
SPEAKER_00: So you'd avoid capital gains tax on the one-forty dollar gain, plus get a charitable deduction.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:05.606
SPEAKER_01: And I can recommend grants from the donor-advised fund over time?

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:15.958
SPEAKER_00: Right. Take the deduction this year when your income is high, then direct the money to charities later.

00:10:17.458 --> 00:10:19.809
SPEAKER_01: That's pretty clever.

00:10:22.258 --> 00:10:28.408
SPEAKER_00: It's a common strategy. Fidelity and Schwab both offer donor-advised fund platforms.

00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:33.208
SPEAKER_01: Any other ways to reduce my tax bill?

00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:41.096
SPEAKER_00: Well, if you're planning any major purchases, consider the timing. Maybe accelerate some expenses into this year.

00:10:41.458 --> 00:10:43.843
SPEAKER_01: Like what kind of expenses?

00:10:46.258 --> 00:10:55.097
SPEAKER_00: Medical expenses, if you have any planned procedures. They're deductible above seven point five percent of AGI.

00:10:56.597 --> 00:11:01.420
SPEAKER_01: Seven point five percent of one-eighty... that's thirteen thousand five hundred.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.931
SPEAKER_00: Right, so unless you have major medical expenses, probably not helpful.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.845
SPEAKER_01: What about investment strategies?

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:21.070
SPEAKER_00: Tax-loss harvesting could help. Any positions in your taxable account that are underwater?

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.577
SPEAKER_01: I bought some tech stocks last year that haven't done well.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:33.070
SPEAKER_00: You could sell those for losses to offset any gains you've realized this year.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.870
SPEAKER_01: How much in losses can I deduct?

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:47.129
SPEAKER_00: Losses offset gains dollar for dollar. If you have net losses, you can deduct three thousand against ordinary income.

00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:50.650
SPEAKER_01: And carry forward the rest?

00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:57.277
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. Indefinitely, at three thousand per year against ordinary income.

00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:02.828
SPEAKER_01: That's something at least.

00:12:05.429 --> 00:12:11.579
SPEAKER_00: Just watch out for the wash sale rule. Can't buy the same security within thirty days.

00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:16.379
SPEAKER_01: What if I want to maintain the position?

00:12:17.429 --> 00:12:23.938
SPEAKER_00: Buy a similar but not identical security. Like VTI instead of VOO - both track the S&P 500.

00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:26.674
SPEAKER_01: Close enough for tax purposes?

00:12:29.429 --> 00:12:38.875
SPEAKER_00: The IRS hasn't given clear guidance on this, but most tax pros think substantially different funds are okay.

00:12:40.375 --> 00:12:42.726
SPEAKER_01: Better to be safe though.

00:12:45.175 --> 00:12:51.325
SPEAKER_00: Agreed. Now, looking ahead to next year, have you thought about maxing out an HSA?

00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:57.396
SPEAKER_01: My company doesn't offer one. Just a regular health plan.

00:12:58.896 --> 00:13:05.046
SPEAKER_00: Too bad. HSAs are triple tax-advantaged - deductible contribution, tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawals for medical.

00:13:06.096 --> 00:13:09.454
SPEAKER_01: Best retirement account nobody talks about?

00:13:10.896 --> 00:13:17.046
SPEAKER_00: Exactly. You can even invest the money and use it for any purpose after sixty-five.

00:13:18.096 --> 00:13:21.846
SPEAKER_01: Maybe I should look for a job with HSA options.

00:13:22.896 --> 00:13:31.448
SPEAKER_00: Ha, don't change jobs just for the HSA. But it's a nice perk if you're ever job hunting.

00:13:32.948 --> 00:13:34.869
SPEAKER_01: What about municipal bonds?

00:13:37.748 --> 00:13:43.898
SPEAKER_00: Could make sense at your tax bracket. California munis yield about three point five percent tax-free.

00:13:44.948 --> 00:13:47.539
SPEAKER_01: What's the taxable equivalent yield?

00:13:49.748 --> 00:13:55.898
SPEAKER_00: At your combined federal and state rate, about... six point three percent.

00:13:56.948 --> 00:14:00.208
SPEAKER_01: That's pretty competitive with CDs, right?

00:14:01.748 --> 00:14:07.898
SPEAKER_00: It is, though munis have interest rate risk if you need to sell before maturity.

00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:11.645
SPEAKER_01: So maybe a small allocation?

00:14:13.748 --> 00:14:19.898
SPEAKER_00: Could work for money you don't need for several years. Just diversify across issuers.

00:14:20.948 --> 00:14:23.854
SPEAKER_01: This has been really helpful.

00:14:25.748 --> 00:14:31.898
SPEAKER_00: Good. Let me summarize the action items. Max out your 401k, do a backdoor Roth conversion...

00:14:32.948 --> 00:14:36.698
SPEAKER_01: Tax-loss harvesting, maybe bunch some charitable contributions...

00:14:37.748 --> 00:14:41.922
SPEAKER_00: Right, and consider making an estimated tax payment to avoid penalties.

00:14:44.948 --> 00:14:47.354
SPEAKER_01: How much should I send in?

00:14:49.748 --> 00:14:54.015
SPEAKER_00: Let me calculate this... probably around five thousand to be safe.

00:14:56.948 --> 00:14:59.215
SPEAKER_01: Due by January fifteenth?

00:15:01.748 --> 00:15:07.898
SPEAKER_00: For Q4, yes. Though if you do all these other strategies, you might not need that much.

00:15:08.948 --> 00:15:10.897
SPEAKER_01: Better safe than sorry.

00:15:13.748 --> 00:15:19.898
SPEAKER_00: Agreed. Underpayment penalties aren't huge, but why give the IRS free money?

00:15:20.948 --> 00:15:24.015
SPEAKER_01: Exactly. Thanks for all the advice.

00:15:25.748 --> 00:15:31.898
SPEAKER_00: You're welcome. High-income earners have more planning opportunities, but also more complexity.

00:15:32.948 --> 00:15:34.890
SPEAKER_01: I'm definitely learning that.

00:15:37.748 --> 00:15:43.898
SPEAKER_00: We'll revisit everything in January once you have your year-end pay stubs and tax documents.

00:15:44.948 --> 00:15:48.698
SPEAKER_01: Sounds good. I'll get started on these strategies.

00:15:49.748 --> 00:15:53.898
SPEAKER_00: Perfect. Don't wait too long - December goes by fast.
