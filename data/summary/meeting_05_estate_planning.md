**Quick Takeaways**
1. Current high estate tax exemptions create "use it or lose it" opportunity before 2026 reduction
2. Annual gifting removes assets plus future growth from taxable estate while maintaining couple's financial security
3. Roth conversions during low-income retirement years provide tax-efficient wealth transfer to heirs
4. Revocable living trust essential for California residents to avoid expensive probate process and maintain privacy
5. Age-based distribution schedules preferable to achievement-based milestones to avoid perverse incentives
6. Estate planning serves dual purpose: tax minimization and ensuring family wishes are properly executed
7. Goal to provide children "enough money to do anything, but not enough to do nothing" guides distribution strategy
