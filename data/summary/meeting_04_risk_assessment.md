# Meeting 04: Risk Assessment Summary

**Meeting Recap**
1. Jennifer, age 42, experiencing sleep loss from portfolio volatility with daily swings of $20,000 on $400,000 total portfolio
2. Current allocation: 80% stocks, 20% bonds, following traditional age-based rule of thumb
3. VIX above 30 for months indicating sustained market volatility and investor fear
4. Risk tolerance assessment revealed $25,000 loss (6% of portfolio) as maximum comfortable threshold
5. S&P 500 dropped 12% in September 2022 alone, causing sleepless nights during that period
6. Proposed allocation change to 60% stocks, 40% bonds to reduce volatility by approximately 20%
7. Expected returns: 60/40 portfolio approximately 8% annually versus 9.5% for 80/20 allocation
8. Average investor underperforms market by 2-3% annually due to poor timing decisions
9. Bond funds down 10% this year due to rising interest rates, challenging traditional "safe" asset perception
10. Individual bonds safer if held to maturity, but bond funds have interest rate risk
11. Duration risk explanation: longer duration bonds more sensitive to interest rate changes
12. International diversification discussed: Europe trading at 13x earnings versus S&P 500 at 24x, emerging markets at 12x
13. Tech sector concentration risk: 30% of S&P 500 now in technology stocks
14. Company-specific risk highlighted with historical examples of Enron and WorldCom failures
15. Rebalancing strategy: quarterly or threshold-based when asset classes move 5+ percentage points from target
16. Market recovery historical perspective: 13 years to break even in real terms from 2000 peak, but including dividends and new contributions improved outcomes
17. Proposed new allocation: 65% stocks (80% US total market, 15% international developed, 5% emerging markets), 35% bonds (70% intermediate-term, 30% short-term)

**Action Items**
1. Jennifer to gradually transition from 80/20 to 65/35 allocation over 3-4 months using dollar-cost averaging approach
2. Implement monthly rebalancing by selling 5% of stock funds and purchasing bonds each month
3. Establish threshold-based rebalancing system: rebalance when any asset class moves 5+ percentage points from target
4. Begin rebalancing process next week if comfortable with proposed allocation strategy
5. Focus on total stock market funds rather than individual stock picking for diversification
6. Consider 10-15% allocation to international stocks within equity portion
7. Maintain systematic, unemotional approach to rebalancing regardless of market conditions
8. Schedule follow-up meeting in a few months to assess comfort level with new allocation

**Quick Takeaways**
1. Portfolio allocation you can stick with is more important than theoretically optimal allocation you abandon
2. Peace of mind has tangible value that doesn't appear in performance charts but affects long-term success
3. Reducing volatility from 80/20 to 60/40 allocation decreases expected returns but may improve actual returns through better behavior
4. Successful investing primarily about controlling emotions rather than maximizing theoretical returns
5. Consistent mediocre returns beat erratic great returns that cause panic selling
6. Systematic rebalancing acts as contrarian investing strategy: automatically buying low and selling high
7. Most successful investment strategies are counterintuitive and feel uncomfortable when implemented
