**Meeting Recap**
1. Robert, age 55, married to Linda for 28 years with two adult children David (26, engineer, good income) and Sarah (24, teacher, lower income, potential house down payment assistance needed).
2. Current asset portfolio totals approximately $1.4 million including: house worth $900,000 (mortgage-free), Robert's RRSP $400,000, Linda's RRSP $200,000, combined TFSAs $180,000 (both maxed), and $300,000 non-registered investments plus $50,000 present value pension.
3. Robert continues working at $130,000 annual income with plans for potential retirement at age 62, providing 7-year window for strategic RRSP withdrawal planning.
4. Canadian deemed disposition rules create significant estate tax burden with full RRSP balance ($400,000) becoming taxable income in final year if passing directly to children, potentially generating $200,000 tax bill (50% of RRSP value).
5. Current estate planning documents (wills, powers of attorney) are 10 years outdated, requiring updates reflecting increased asset values and changing family circumstances.
6. RRSP-to-TFSA conversion strategy involves gradual withdrawals during lower-income retirement years, paying tax at reduced rates and contributing after-tax amounts to TFSA ($7,000 annual room per person in 2024) for tax-free future growth.
7. Spousal RRSP rollover option allows Linda to inherit Robert's RRSP tax-free, deferring taxation until her death but potentially creating larger estate tax problem for children.

**Action Items**
1. Robert and Linda to consult estate lawyer for updated wills and separate powers of attorney documents (financial and personal care) with children as backup attorneys if both incapacitated.
2. Implement strategic RRSP withdrawal plan starting at age 62 retirement to reduce estate tax exposure, converting withdrawn amounts to TFSA contributions within annual limits.
3. Consider term life insurance ($200,000 coverage, approximately $1,500 annual premiums) to provide estate liquidity for tax payments without forcing asset sales.
4. Evaluate spousal RRSP contribution opportunities given income differential, allowing Robert's tax deductions while building Linda's retirement income for tax bracket equalization.
5. Explore lifetime gifting strategy for Sarah's house down payment using cash or appreciated investments, triggering capital gains at controlled timing and amounts.
6. Coordinate with estate tax specialist accountant to model different RRSP withdrawal scenarios and optimize timing for tax minimization.

**Quick Takeaways**
1. Canadian estate taxation through deemed disposition creates potential $200,000 tax bill on Robert's RRSP alone, requiring proactive withdrawal planning during lifetime to minimize estate burden.
2. Principal residence exemption protects $900,000 house value from capital gains taxation, representing significant tax-free wealth transfer opportunity to beneficiaries.
3. Charitable donation strategy in final tax year can eliminate substantial estate taxes through 100% net income deduction limits plus prior year carryback, providing roughly 50% tax credit value.
4. Strategic RRSP withdrawals during 7-year pre-retirement window allow tax-rate optimization, converting high-tax-rate assets to tax-free TFSA growth vehicles.
5. Life insurance provides estate liquidity solution, enabling tax payment without forced asset liquidation, though premium costs require evaluation against self-insurance alternatives.
6. Updated estate planning documentation essential given 10-year gap and substantial asset value increases, ensuring proper beneficiary designations and executor selection for complex estate administration.
