**Meeting Recap**
1. Michael, age 32, earns $87,000 annually (received raise in June) and currently pays approximately 33% combined federal and provincial marginal tax rate in Ontario.
2. Michael has $8,000 already contributed to RRSP this year with $7,600 remaining contribution room for current year, plus $11,000 in unused room from previous years, totaling $18,600 maximum RRSP contribution capacity.
3. Current monthly take-home income is $5,200 with rent expenses of $2,200, providing sufficient cash flow to increase RRSP contributions by $500 monthly ($6,000 annually).
4. Michael's RRSP funds are currently sitting in savings account earning minimal returns, missing growth potential compared to conservative portfolios averaging 6-7% historically.
5. Recommended investment allocation includes 60% Canadian equity (VCN), 20% US equity, 10% international equity, and 10% bonds through low-cost ETFs.
6. Michael has $43,000 in unused TFSA contribution room and makes $200 annual charitable donations to United Way through work.
7. Michael and girlfriend have been living together for 2 years (3-year relationship total), qualifying as common-law for potential spousal RRSP strategies given her $45,000 income placing her in lower tax bracket.

**Action Items**
1. Michael to increase monthly RRSP contribution by $300 (from current level to $1,000 monthly) to maximize tax savings of approximately $1,300 annually.
2. Advisor to send detailed ETF information including ticker symbols, expense ratios, and implementation plan for portfolio transition from savings account to diversified investments.
3. Michael to consider gradual RRSP-to-TFSA conversion strategy using annual tax refunds to contribute to TFSA in subsequent years.
4. Schedule follow-up meeting in 6 months to review progress on increased contribution amounts and assess budget impact.
5. Michael to maintain focus on cash contributions rather than RRSP loans, despite potential for leveraged investing strategies.
6. Consider implementing spousal RRSP contributions to optimize long-term retirement tax planning with girlfriend given income differential.

**Quick Takeaways**
1. Increasing RRSP contributions from $8,000 to $12,000 annually would generate approximately $1,300 in tax savings while building retirement wealth through 33% marginal tax rate benefit.
2. Current investment approach of holding RRSP funds in savings account represents significant opportunity cost compared to diversified ETF portfolio with historical 6-7% returns.
3. Strong savings discipline and cash flow capacity ($5,200 take-home minus $2,200 rent) provides foundation for increased retirement contributions without lifestyle impact.
4. Low-cost ETF strategy (VGRO at 0.25% expense ratio versus 2% mutual fund fees) can preserve significantly more wealth over 30-year investment horizon.
5. Common-law relationship status creates opportunities for spousal RRSP income splitting to optimize household tax efficiency during retirement years.
6. TFSA room of $43,000 represents substantial tax-free growth opportunity that should be prioritized after maximizing RRSP tax deductions.
