**Meeting Recap**
1. Amanda, age 38, earns $85,000 annually with good job security, no dependents, and emergency fund in place, but experiences significant anxiety during market volatility, losing sleep and checking account balances multiple times daily during banking crisis.
2. Current portfolio allocation of 85% equities and 15% bonds (50/50 split between Canadian VCN and US VTI) represents aggressive positioning compared to traditional age-based rule suggesting 62% stocks and 38% bonds.
3. Portfolio dropped 15% in two weeks during recent banking crisis, triggering panic-selling consideration and daily account monitoring behavior, indicating emotional risk tolerance below financial capacity for volatility.
4. Historical analysis shows 2008 financial crisis produced 57% peak-to-trough S&P 500 decline, with Amanda confirming inability to withstand 50% portfolio loss but potential tolerance for 30% maximum drawdown.
5. Risk tolerance assessment reveals disconnect between financial capacity (can afford significant losses) and emotional tolerance (cannot handle volatility without behavioral mistakes), requiring portfolio adjustment to prevent panic-selling during downturns.
6. Diversification analysis shows significant home country bias with 50% Canadian allocation despite Canada representing only 3% of global market capitalization, missing international diversification benefits.
7. Portfolio rebalancing strategy discussed including quarterly/semi-annual frequency to maintain target allocations, using new contributions to buy underweight assets rather than triggering taxable sales in non-registered accounts.

**Action Items**
1. Amanda to transition from current 85/15 allocation to 60/40 or 70/30 stocks-to-bonds ratio over 3-month period, selling one-third of current holdings monthly to minimize timing risk through dollar-cost averaging.
2. Implement global diversification strategy with approximately 25% Canada, 40% US, 20% international developed markets, and 15% emerging markets allocation to reduce home country bias.
3. Consider single balanced ETF solution (VBAL at 60/40 allocation, 0.22% expense ratio) for automatic rebalancing and reduced complexity versus individual ETF management.
4. Evaluate bond allocation diversification adding international bonds (30% of bond allocation) alongside core Canadian bond holdings for currency diversification.
5. Amanda to establish rebalancing discipline using new contributions to purchase underweight asset classes rather than triggering capital gains through sales in taxable accounts.
6. Schedule annual portfolio review to ensure allocation continues matching evolving risk tolerance and life circumstances while avoiding frequent tinkering based on market movements.

**Quick Takeaways**
1. Emotional risk tolerance mismatch with aggressive portfolio allocation creates behavioral investing risks, with panic-selling during downturns potentially causing permanent wealth destruction despite strong financial capacity.
2. Portfolio simplification through balanced ETF (VBAL) provides automatic rebalancing, global diversification, and volatility management at minimal additional cost (0.22% vs 0.05% individual ETFs).
3. Maximum drawdown targeting around 30% through 60/40 or 70/30 allocation balances growth potential with emotional comfort, preventing behavioral mistakes during inevitable market corrections.
4. International diversification reduces concentration risk from Canadian market bias, providing hedge against domestic economic cycles and sector-specific downturns in financials and resources.
5. Rebalancing discipline using new contributions rather than sales minimizes tax consequences while maintaining target allocations, turning market volatility into wealth-building opportunity.
6. Historical perspective shows balanced portfolios (VBAL) recovered faster from COVID crash than pure equity funds, finishing 2020 positive despite 20% March decline, demonstrating resilience value.
