# Exploration Phase: Information Discovery

## Your Mission
**Discover and document comprehensive information** about building financial advisory agents. Focus on gathering intelligence that will inform later planning phases.

## Target System Goals
Research information for building 2 agent capabilities:
1. **Meeting Intelligence**: transcript/summary → relevant URLs/references/explanations
2. **Strategic Advisory**: transcript + summary + client profile → tailored investment strategy

## Available Context
- **Data**: `data/transcript/`, `data/summary/`, `data/client-profile/`
- **Tools**: CRA publications (Weaviate RAG), Statistics Canada API, Bank of Canada API, Twelve Data API
- **Context**: 3-day bootcamp for developers learning agent systems

## Research Areas

### Current Financial Agent Landscape
- What financial AI agent systems exist today and how do they work?
- What are the specific technical architectures successful systems use?
- How do meeting transcription tools work in financial advisory context?
- What decision-making patterns do robo-advisors and advisory AI actually implement?

### Agent Architecture Patterns
- What agent reasoning patterns exist beyond basic ReAct?
- Which multi-agent architectures are proven in production financial systems?
- What are the technical implementation details of successful agent patterns?
- How do different agent frameworks compare for financial use cases?

### Canadian Financial Data Ecosystem
- What APIs and data sources are available from Canadian government/financial institutions?
- How do production Canadian fintech systems integrate regulatory data?
- What are the technical specifications and limitations of available APIs?
- What compliance and regulatory requirements apply to financial AI systems in Canada?

### Technical Implementation Challenges
- What are the common technical pitfalls when building financial agents?
- How do successful systems handle data integration, API reliability, and error handling?
- What are the specific challenges with Canadian financial meeting transcripts vs. generic text?
- How do production systems structure client profiles and risk assessment data?

### Adjacent Domain Insights
- How do other domains (medical, legal, consulting) handle similar expert advisory challenges?
- What patterns from successful multi-agent systems could apply to financial advisory?
- How do knowledge graph systems work in financial contexts?
- What can we learn from chatbot and conversational AI implementations in finance?

## Investigation Approach
Research successful implementations, study technical documentation, analyze case studies, and identify patterns that could inform our system design. Document findings comprehensively for later planning phases.

**Focus on discovery, not planning. Gather intelligence for informed decision-making.**
